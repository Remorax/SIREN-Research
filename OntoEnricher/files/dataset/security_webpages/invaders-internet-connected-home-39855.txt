With this rising need of network connectivity to the average home, the role called the
“administrator-of-things” exists in which there would be responsible individual/s worrying about
some aspects of the home networked environment: uptime, updates, connectivity,
troubleshooting … and security. In the not-so-distant-past, these aspects were just a worry of an
enterprise systems/network administrator where the stakes were uptime and business continuity,
and now these tasks have silently creeped in the household within the last few years. This paper
would look into network-based threats that would attempt to break in and, in the process, explore
the dangers that may befall the budding “administrator-of-things”.

1. Introduction

Fu

A recent interconnected device survey assessed that the average household has 11 connected

ns

devices, and that twenty-eight percent of consumers would have a variety of smart home devices.

ai

This report also mentioned that home owners who had multiple smart home devices tend to

et

spend more on internet bandwidth (Build it and they will embrace it | Deloitte, 2019) as all of

rR

these smart home devices may contend for internet bandwidth. This steady trend in saturating the

ho

average home with internet connected things was an expected effect of the internet of things

ut

(IoT) or, right now, the internet of everything (IoE) – equivocally leading to the fact that every

,A

piece of device that can be connected to the internet will be connected to the internet.

itu

te

With this, the average home unintentionally needs “administrator-of-things”, a mixed role of

st

a handyman and a multi-user IT Administrator, whose responsibility would be to worry about

In

some aspects of the home networked environment (TrendLabs Security Intelligence Blog, 2014).

NS

For example, a slight internet outage for an internet connected home would be immediately felt
by various aspects of the household – ranging from the loss of control for temperature

SA

(thermostat), visibility (camera), lighting automation, and screens that rely on streaming content.

e

Aside from worrying about connectivity and uptime, this role would need to worry about

Th

keeping these devices updated – if not for newer features that may be offered by the vendor, then

20

probably to ensure that patches are applied to the device for increased security. Sounds familiar?

20

Indeed, all of these factors play very much in the day to day operations of a business that

©

requires internet connectivity to provide services.
At the time of writing, there is also a wider acceptance of companies for working from home.
With this, the boundaries of a secure working environment is blurred: how can an organization
ensure that remote workers are not opening up doors for remote attacks when a home network is
beyond the mandate and scope of the enterprise IT organization?
It should be noted that this paper also includes an initial effort to profile threats to an internet
connected home. With the initial research was conducted around July 2016, and would
differentiate what observed activities 4 years after.

1.1 TCP/IP based devices – hardwired or wireless

Fu

A research into classifications of devices within a Smart Home ("Classification of functions

ns

in smart home," 2012), there are generally four classifications of devices within a Smart Home:


et

ai

Electro – this includes touch panels, control appliances, kitchen appliances, garage

rR

openers, or irrigation (sprinkler) systems. These aspects of a home that were usually

ho

utilized through manual operations that has been introduced to the internet-connected
world.


,A

ut

Audio/Video – includes home theatre, music, and games. Most commonly
experienced through Smart TVs, smart speakers, gaming consoles and streaming



te

sticks.

itu

Security – this would generally include systems that provide safety, more commonly

In

st

found in homes. Web-enabled IP cameras, baby monitors, motion detections and
alarms are part of this group.


NS

Environment, energy and health – almost all devices that comfortable living

SA

conditions fall in this group: heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC)

e

systems, shutters, lighting, or even internet connected weighing scales and exercise

Th

trackers.

20

Aside from these devices that may be permanent fixtures within a Smart Home, let us not

©

20

forget that there are other “productivity-related” devices that are also connected, which includes

computers, laptops, tablets, printers and the like.

1.2 Smart Home Hubs
Having a few internet connected (a.k.a., “smart”) device would mostly work with various
apps cluttered in your personal device (i.e., phone, tablet). However, as these devices grow in
number, having a Smart Home (Automation) Hub. In general, a Smart Home Automation Hub
“serves as the nerve center of your home automation system and ties all of your devices
together” ("What is a smart home hub (And do you need one)?" 2014). Depending on the vendor
of your Smart Home Hub, it can support multiple protocols including:


Bluetooth

Wi-Fi (mostly through web-based APIs)

There are also support for vendor-specific protocols such as Apple HomeKit, Lutron Clear

rR

Connect (lighting), and Kidde (smoke and CO alarm) wireless protocols. Most of them also

ho

integrate with “smart assistants” like Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and often integration

with If This then That (IFTTT) web services.

2. Normal outbound network traffic flow within the observed

itu

te

home network

st

For most configurations, home networks are largely controlled by the home network’s

In

firewall/router devices and such devices are designed to 1) allow all outbound network access

NS

and 2) deny inbound connection connections. There are, however, certain conditions wherein a

SA

home network’s firewall/router device may be configured to allow incoming traffic:

e

a) Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) or Network Address Translation Port Mapping Protocol

Th

(NAT-PMP)

20

The term UPnP may be a little bit more popular than NAT-PMP as it is a ubiquitous term

©

20

utilized by a lot of devices, while NAT-PMP is commonly found in Apple devices and
programs. Both of these functionality though function the say way: if the home
router/firewall device supports it, these devices/programs that utilize either UPnP or
NAT-PMP can dynamically add port forwards and firewall entries. Most common of
these devices would be a gaming console, and programs such as BitTorrent would utilize
the same as well.

b) Manually configured by the home owner
In some configurations that UPnP doesn’t natively work on the home network, a home
owner may configure the firewall functionality to allow certain ports inbound to a
destination device. There are several configurations of this: either setting the device up in
the DMZ location of a home network, 1-to-1 mapping for port forwarding or even port
triggering features. Such terminologies may be straightforward for a firewall

administrator for a business setting, but not so much for the regular home user. It may,

Fu

however, come into discussion if one of the members of the household would be playing

ns

online games that require “hosting” a game on a Microsoft Windows PC located within

ai

the home network. Another possible instance of configuring such inbound access would

et

be if the home owner would like to take advantage of certain functionalities of the home

rR

router, such as “offering a locally attached USB storage to be accessible anywhere”.

ho

The next few sections would discuss observations on a home network with mostly outbound

ut

connectivity, with only one section having a port-forwarding rule found in the second example

,A

for 2.5 Productivity for a particular Microsoft Windows game. Both UPnP and NAT-PMP is

te

disabled within the observed network environment, and the observation was performed for the

entire July 2020.

During the time of observation, the TCP/31314 traffic was consistently communicating with
a well-known web hosting provider (Amazon AWS).

2.3 Security

Home security panels that aspects of the dwelling (e.g., doors, windows, gates, heat, smoke,

rR

freeze) during certain states (e.g., armed, disarmed, stay or away) usually communicate with
sensors that could either be a combination of hardwired or wireless methods. These wireless

ho

methods aren’t necessarily Wi-Fi, and operate in a specific range of signals (e.g., 345 MHz, 900

ut

MHz), depending on the vendor of such device. Further, while Wi-Fi-only home security control

,A

panels exists, most of these home security panels would have a battery backup and communicate

te

through cellular radio modules. That being said, another device that was put into consideration

was a home security control panel, through its “IP communicator” add-on device, which is

usually offered as an option for “backup communications” to the monitoring service’s Central

Traffic analysis of such device reveals that its communication protocol was only for

UDP/1121 that was for the monitoring service’s Central Station. No other ports or hosts were
observed.
Next, a home security suite that provided video recording (including Wi-Fi-enabled
doorbells) were observed during the same time period. While there were numerous ports
observed, some of which not documented by the vendor, we will go through the top common
ports observed:

3. Observing an attack: initial methodology and findings

Fu

In July 2016, the author had performed an initial effort to profile internet-connected threats,

ns

choosing to analyze network-based threats by implementing honeypots. Honeypots are great

ai

since there are a lot of free and open-source options and gathers a great deal of data to analyze.

et

The voluminous amount of data may be a challenge to analyze, but the approach that was chosen

rR

was to separate mass-scanning activities of the internet and differentiate that with traffic that is

ho

dedicated to an internet home. As such, it was decided to setup honeypot nodes that are hosted in

ut

a virtual private server (VPS) and a dedicated one at home. A separate observation was done on

,A

the traffic directed at the VPS servers, comparing it with the traffic directed specifically at our

te

home network. Immediately, we did see some traffic that was specific to our monitored home

itu

network – and we decided to observe the traffic for the entire month of July 2016, and both the

In

st

VPS server and the home are located within the United States.

NS

Also, note that we classify one probe as a unique combination of: source IP address, source
port and destination port, thereby one probe equates to one attempt. For example, one IP address

SA

that probed, say, the existence of both HTTP and SMTP ports (port 80 and 25, respectively)

e

would be two entries in our list as one attempt would have a different source port and destination

Th

port. Here are the initial numbers:



Out of the 33,197 probes to our VPS server, we counted only 686 probes to our home
network of which only 337 probes (49.12%) were specific to our home network, while

©

the other 349 probes were shared between our home network and our VPS server. This
tells us that around 50% of the time, our monitored home network received unique traffic
that is not seen at our VPS server. These 337 probes that are specific to our home
network would be the object of interest.


There were only 209 unique IP addresses doing all 337 probes to our home network some hosts were scanning the home network multiple times and, at one point, across
multiple protocols:

o Out of the 209 unique IP addresses, we counted 42 hosts that had repeated probes

on the same destination port, but one host out of the 42 had probed our home

network twice for different ports.

The top two ports that was sought out were 1433 (Microsoft SQL Server) and 3389

(Microsoft Remote Desktop), with 27.59% and 27.29% respectively.

,A

These initial results show that majority of the hosts that are external to our home network

te

were seeking something very specific, with just a handful of ports (and, thereby, services) being

itu

of their interest. For now, we have looked into the connection attempts and captured data of the

st

209 unique hosts to our home network. After that, we created potential malicious profiles based

In

on the attempts to introduce threats to our home network – particularly looking into the entry

NS

attempts, methods of entry and other suspicious activities. We came up with four possible

With the main interest in being able to determine TCP ports, and to make sense of the

changes in the landscape, honeypots were again deployed to determine what are attacking these
ports:


TCP ports 23, 1433, 5555 and 22 are mostly being targeted with the MIRAI botnet
("Mirai widens distribution with new Trojan," 2017), which was first seen around August
of 2016 ("MMD-0056-2016 - Linux/Mirai, how an old ELF malcode is recycled.," 2016).
There are various version and iterations of MIRAI, but is mainly targeting Linux Servers
and IoT devices running Linux-based firmware called Busybox, which is common in
DVRs, CCTVs and IP-based cameras. Not surprisingly, the TCP port 5555 is for the
Android Debug Port (ADB) that was reportedly left open in some Android-based phones
("Open ADB ports used to spread possible satori variant," 2018). This is also the same

to name a few. Several attempts were also attributed to a Perl-based backdoor ("Outlaw's

5. Why apply Network Micro-segmentation when working

20

from home?

20

Whether working from home is a norm that a company allows, or have just been recently

©

allowed due to certain conditions, one of the perceived benefits of working from home is that it
can allow workers to minimize distractions and increase the time they spend focused on a
project. However, the IT security risks for such arrangements are well known, such as:
a) Physical security and the boundaries of work data vs personal data, where personal
information may co-mingle with corporate data. This not only applies to data stored on a
company owned and provisioned asset (e.g., laptop), but on USB disks or flash drives.
b) Network security. In a corporate environment, network devices are often scanned for,
patched updated to protect against vulnerabilities. Suspicious network usage (e.g.,
unusual outbound network requests, network scanning) may also be recognized if traffic
within a corporate environment should this be monitored. In a home network setting, a

compromise of a home based router, or any IOT device, which may be stepping stone to

Fu

ns

by an IT administrator.

ai

c) Host security. Similar to network security, regular patching may be part of the regular

et

monthly maintenance, with patches being pushed out through enterprise means of patch

rR

management. Alongside this, the deployment of host-based security software

ho

(antimalware software, host based intrusion prevention/detection systems, data loss

ut

prevention, etc.) would not extend to other personal devices within the home network.

,A

On the other hand, micro-segmentation is the concept of creating very granular segments

te

within an IT infrastructure, to which the objective is to effectively limit the size of the network’s

itu

attack surface by ensuring unrelated network segments are “walled-off”. It has been previously

st

established that network micro-segmentation does provide additional security (“Does Network

In

Micro-segmentation Provide Additional Security?” Jaworski, 2017), and that the basis of this

NS

security model is from the “Zero Trust Model” introduced by Forrester Research (Kindervag &

SA

Ferrara, 2013). So not to be confused by the two terms, it is important to bear in mind that microsegmentation is an implementation of the Zero Trust Model. Most importantly, Zero Trust Model

Th

e

advocates that security professionals must eliminate the idea of a “trusted network”, otherwise

20

known as the internal network, and the “untrusted network”, which is usually the external

©

20

network. There are three fundamental concepts in the Zero Trust Model:


Concept No. 1: Ensure that all resources are accessed securely regardless of location



Concept No. 2: Adopt a least privilege strategy and strictly enforce access control



Concept No. 3: Inspect and log all traffic

A working example of the Zero Trust Model includes the implementation of microsegmentation, wherein the end-result of this is trying to protect hosts that reside within the same
security zone. The usual approach would be to segment an entire network according to the
functional subnet, VLAN or broadcast domain, after which only the necessary resources are
exposed between the separations (east-west traffic) and further complemented with the use of
host-based solutions such as a host intrusion/prevention system (HID/PS) to extend the
implementation up to the most atomic component of a corporate network. These approaches have

ll

been present in most enterprise networks through physical switches or routers and, in today’s

Fu

world of virtual switches and software define networks (SDNs), such implementation may be

ns

widely accepted within an enterprise network. The integration of host intrusion/prevention

et

ai

system (HID/PS) within antimalware security suites has also been quite common.

rR

So how can this be implemented in a home network? Over the past few years, the author had
tried multiple methods of implementing VLANs within a home network and, unless the home

ho

owner would introduce costly enterprise-grade hardware within a home network, found it overly

ut

complex for most end-users to implement using commodity hardware. However, two features

Second, Access Point (AP) Isolation is another option that home users can also implement,

Fu

and is usually hidden in under the advanced configuration of a wireless access point. The effect

the Access Point (AP) Isolation. This feature would work well in conjunction with host-based

Commonly, such prompts will let the end-user know that the recommendation is to allow the

endpoint to be discoverable on the home network. The common practice is to select “Yes” for

ns

home or work networks, and “No” if you are connecting to an unknown and untrusted location

such as a coffee-shop or an internet cafe. However, there is practically no reason to keep the

6. Recommendations

,A

The management of home networks definitely looks like enterprise networks and the recent

te

wide acceptance of remote work, or working from home, makes it clear that threats that may

itu

affect the home would open the possibility of compromising the enterprise network. At this

st

point, here are a few challenges that we think the "administrator-of-things" has to heavily

Make sure all your internal devices are up-to-date to cover known issues and

NS

consider:

SA

vulnerabilities. In most cases, the prolonged use of old technology opens your family
members to the possibility of being either the victim or the attacker, or maybe both.

Th

e

Ensure that the device that you’re picking up has a stable history of providing patches for

20

their software and ensure that the device is still within maintenance of the vendor. Once a

20

device is out of date, heavily consider replacing it even though it still works. Patch
management is critical in enterprise network, and a similar approach in keeping software

©

up-to-date applies, for all the devices, in your home network as well.


Look into possible security options of your devices, and take advantage of them when
possible. The main purpose of a cable modem is to connect your home to your cable
company/ISP and bring wired/wireless connectivity options. It may take a while for ISPprovided home routers to have better security options, and so it may cost a little extra.
There is very little (if any) offering in that device for any type of security - mostly a just
basic firewall and access control, maybe parental options for time restraints and keyword
filtering. In fact, most documentation would just mention maintaining your endpoint like
keeping your patches and anti-virus up to date - and scant information about "security",

on to your network. If it is absolutely necessary for that device to connect through your

your important assets – like your corporate laptop/device. If not for the IOT devices, do it

7. Conclusion
Without a doubt, the role called the "administrator-of-things" is a necessity for today's smart
home. Long gone are the simple days wherein an internet connection to the home is solely used
for a student trying to submit homework, a professional completing some last minute research
for a big business presentation the next day, a child playing online games or streaming internet
content to watch videos or catch-up with social media. Today's internet connected home consists
of a combination of devices that gives access, control and visibility on multiple aspects of a

administrative means should be grouped and made to communicate to each other only.
For devices that synchronizes any information in the cloud, make sure to secure it. From
small businesses to large enterprises, nothing is worse than a data breach. The same
would apply to the smart home: a vendor-provided portal that is poorly secured may
allow unauthorized users to acquire personal information, or even spy on you or your
family members.
A differential comparison between 2016 and 2020 showed that there is approximately

49% unique traffic directed at an internet connected home, but the scale of it has been
massive: a contrast of TCP attacks between 4 years (2016: 337 vs 2020: 10,726) had
increased over 3,182.78%. The nature of the threats that are a cause of these attacks, the

et

Most of these threats directly compromise the home router, the main and most important

device within a home network. A smart home, and other possible vulnerable devices hosted
therein, may therefore be enslaved in a larger pool of infected devices. But as damaging as it

companies who allow remote work should also put guidelines for their employees

beyond simple recommendations of “using the device for office work, and go through the
