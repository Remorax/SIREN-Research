# README

This git repository contains the entirety of my research work done as a UG Researcher at SERC, IIIT-Hyderabad.

It contains the following subdirectories:

1. `OntoEnricher`, an LSTM-based model to extract concepts and relationships from a text corpus and using them to enrich a seed ontology
    
2. `OntoViewer`, a WebVOWL based tool to visualize and validate ontologies. The `TweetCredibility` subdirectory contains a Multinomial NB classifier to predict the credibility of a Twitter account based on posts and followers 

3. `OntologyEnrichment-Survey`, the codebase for a literature survey in the field of Ontology Enrichment from Text. Contains implementations of the following algorithms: 
	a. [Guided Hierarchical Clustering](https://pub.uni-bielefeld.de/download/2497720/2525546/Cimiano_Learning_Concep_1.pdf)
	b. [Formal Concept Analysis](https://www.jair.org/index.php/jair/article/download/10421/24984)
	c. [C-PANKOW algorithm](https://pub.uni-bielefeld.de/download/2497657/2525517/pci_www05.pdf)  
	d. [Word2Vec algorithms](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1690/paper37.pdf)
