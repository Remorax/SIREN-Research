I am generally not a big fan of Domino's but had to go yesterday as my niece likes pizzas and Domino's is the closest to home. We ordered couple of veg singles, and one lebanese roll. Thankfully, we had some food before going to Domino's, so we only ordered little. Firstly, we had to wait for more than 30min for our food. Knowing their business model, I should not have expected anything better. They focus on home delivery and only then think about customers in the restaurant. They delivered faster to customers who have come for take away (many of them came after us). Even though the order was not huge (just 3 items) and the sales person said it will take about 15-20 min in the end we had to wait for more than 30 min. Next was the most interesting encounter. I asked the sales person for few extra packets of chilli ketchup. But he said it is chargeable. I was too stunned to say anything. Really Domino's, you want to charge customers who are spending more than Rs 300 on an average walk-in, Rs 1.50 for a packet of ketchup. In all my life, I have never seen this. It is not about Rs 1.50, of course if I am spending so much, I can definitely afford to buy your ketchup, but do I need to? Seriously, am never even going to step in once more. And chatting with the waiter, he was very candid. He said that the cheese used in the \"Pizzamania\" (so called promotional offers) \n"

It’s probably difficult to visualise a make-shift pizzeria with a well-equipped oven to operate from. But the cart located near Koramangala Police Station is a heaven for foodies, especially college students and young professionals who opt to go there instead of ordering in from other popular pizza chains. “The owner Kumara has worked in several restaurants before this in both Mumbai and Bangalore and that is where he learnt the art of making pizzas. His idea was to create a mini-restaurant that was accessible to all, not just those who could anyway afford it,” informs Arun, who runs the cart and is the ‘head chef’ so to say. “We’ve been open for over two years and seen business only get better as time passes. A lot of that has to do with the regulars that we’ve built up and new customers who often tell us that somebody they knew recommended it to them,” he adds. Affordability is the key factory that works in the eatery’s favour, with four slices of garlic bread coming for Rs 20, Rs 60 for a Margarita pizza \n",

Portland chefs and restaurateurs have delved deep into what the ingenious concoction of baked dough with tomato and cheese on top can offer, and we’re all the better for it.

Or maybe because of their seven hour happy hour.       Nostrana    Buckman  Casual fine Italian dining with traditional pizzas Neapolitan pizza from six-time James Beard Award finalist Cathy Whims sounds fussy, but there’s nothing overwrought about the rustic combinations she dreams up to complement her beautiful crust. Just don’t expect to get it sliced. That’s not how they do it in Naples.                  Share on Facebook      Pin it        Orion Landau       Sizzle Pie    Burnside (& other locations)  Punk rock late-night pizza spots serving greasy slices Open late with multiple locations, Sizzle Pie is Portland’s favorite punk rock pizza place. The floppy, thin-crust pizza slices are authentically New York (they even have a location in Brooklyn now), and you can always find a pepperoni, meat special, vegetarian, and even vegan option by the slice every night. Best, all locations are open until 3 or 4am, depending on the day of the week, and serve beer and wine until just after 2am, if you want to keep the party going.       Lovely's Fifty-Fifty    Mississippi Avenue  Northwest-style pies with a focus on seasonal, local ingredients Lovely’s Fifty-Fifty is a decidedly Northwest style pizza restaurant. This ostensibly means they incorporate rich homemade tomato sauces using local ingredients, and an array of toppings that might be frowned at in a New York pizza shop, but reflect the seasonality of Portland cuisine. Think squash and ricotta with brown butter in fall, nettles in spring, and locally harvested chanterelles to mark the end of summer. While it’s tempting to stick to classics like the great margherita, Lovely’s Fifty-Fifty really shines when it plays with local flavors and unexpected combinations.                  Share on Facebook      Pin it        Drew Tyson/Thrillist       Escape From New York Pizza    Northwest  Iconic Portland pizza dive We’re assuredly going to get some flak for this. Some might say that Straight from New York or Atlas Pizza have more authentic New York-style slices. Some might also (fairly) argue that Sizzle Pie is the best. Others would likely throw any of our pizzas on the ground and declare them unfit by the rigorous NYC standards. But Escape From New York has been serving its reheated slices of pepperoni and cheese pizzas out of its narrow, dingy space since 1983 to an unending audience, and for that, we’ve gotta give it up.       Apizza Scholls    Hawthorne  New Haven-style pizza that’s worth the wait The line outside of Apizza Scholls has become as iconic as the pies themselves. Unlike certain other spots in the city that boast a long waiting period, Apizza Scholls is worth it, featuring handcrafted, thin-crust pizza with only the essential toppings. There’s no calling ahead, they have a limit on ingredients for custom pizzas (and no substitutions or omissions on the house ones), and when they run out of dough, you run out of luck. But the pizzas coming out of the electric ovens aren’t just some of the best in the city, but some of the best in the country .                  Share on Facebook      Pin it        Alan Weiner       Ken's Artisan Pizza    Buckman  Wood-fired, Neapolitan style pizzas Ken Forkish’s eponymous pizza place has long led the city’s trend of wood oven, thin-crust Neapolitan style pizzas. The pies are simple, with dollops of fresh mozzarella resting in the tangy tomato sauce, with just a few toppings each. Whether you’re getting it with olives, peppers, or soppressata, it’s highly recommended -- even required -- that you add a pile of fresh, bitter arugula on top. Grab a glass of wine or a Negroni for the full “I wish I could be on the Italian coast but I’m broke so this works” experience.       Pizza Jerk    Cully  Bold new pizza spot with unconventional NY-style pies A New York-style pizza topped with Tommy Habetz’s ( Bunk Sandwiches ) indulgent toppings, Pizza Jerk has become a mainstay in Portland’s food and drink industry culture, as well as the city at large. While you can always find a slice of cheese or pepperoni, you can also find pizzas topped with char siu and pineapple, ribs, and even chicken Parmigiana. It’s over the top, it’s extravagant, and it’s necessary & delicious.      related           The Local's Guide to Ashland         related           The Worst Dates Portland Waiters and Bartenders Have Ever Witnessed                     Share on Facebook      Pin it         Oven & Shaker        Oven & Shaker    Pearl District  Restaurant and cocktail bar with light, doughy pizzas One of the original ChefStable projects, Oven & Shaker is a collaboration between expert pizza chef Cathy Whims of Nostrana (a fantastic pizza joint in its own right) and venerable bartender Ryan Magarian. Today it continues to deliver on the promise it started with back in 2011: excellent craft cocktails paired with delicious wood-fired oven pizza in a casual, saloon-style atmosphere.       Mississippi Pizza    Mississippi  Family-friendly pizza restaurant and music venue While the Mississippi neighborhood is best known for its bars and venues, Mississippi Pizza is a great place for all ages. The pizza isn’t the absolute best in Portland, but it’s a totally solid option for the neighborhood and available gluten-free. The space, however, is a welcoming, family-friendly restaurant that also serves as occasional music venue for local and touring acts. So catch a show, feed the kids, have a beer, and kick back.

This is especially true during happy hour, which runs both early and late, only on the patio and in the bar. Then you can find margheritas, blancos, \n"

Unless she was planning on eating those dead lizards, she's begging for a trip to HR and possibly a visit from the cops for food tampering. Yes, it's still food tampering when it's your food if you have a reasonable expectation that someone else will be eating it.

It was indeed quite greasy, but I used many paper towels to soak up the excess. I was pretty pleased with my abomination until I read this thread and discovered that I'm a monster for using cheddar cheese (the cheap grocery store kind, naturally). Nobody has claimed that adding cheddar to a pizza makes you a monster. After all, you already had four cheeses as the base on that pizza.

And yet Pizza Frutti di Mare is a real thing, Mozzarella not included. And it's bad. Getting dough cooked enough involves overcooking pretty much everything from the sea, unless you can get, like, seal steaks or something. I have seen a well executed white pizza with clams. This is actually a very popular option at Frank Pepe's in New Haven, and at Comet Ping Pong in DC.  If you can get fresh clams and have a proper pizza oven that can get to high temps, it's an absolutely awesome pizza. As far as pineapple goes, the vast majority of it on pizza is terrible, because most places just use canned chunks and those are awful.  There's a place local to me that puts it on a couple of their pies, but they cut it fresh, and roast it beforehand, which mellows out the sweetness a bit and bakes off a good bit of the moisture.  It's also not one of the starring ingredients.  Those pizzas are awesome.

It depends a lot on what it's melting into. If you've got something that can absorb the grease like, say, a tasty bread to melt it into, then it's great. But if you're trying to melt it onto a flatbread or crust that's going to be coated with oil already, and then topped with even more items that are likely to be a bit oily themselves, you're going to run into issues with it's tendency to separate like it does. And cheddar can be great for fondue, but you have to blend it thoroughly once it's melted and it needs to stay melted.

Yes, it changed a bit in quality after the original owners moved on, but still fun, even s bit quirky in decor, but unpretentious and good pizza. Great place for families, groups, etc. Can get busy at peak times.       Dec 30, 2018                                                                                    by Brian S.    The pizza is tasty (average but not stellar) but the staff has no idea how to run a restaurant. The manager was flustered and clueless; running around yelling random orders to her staff who clearly doesn't know what she's talking about. And seriously...a full hour and 20 minute wait to make ONE PIZZA? We were seated without being told that you have to leave your table and go to the end of the line and wait to place your order. Nice to know beforehand. Cashier messed up order 3 times. The most amazing thing was when the manager told the family behind me that they couldn't get their pizza THAT THEY HAD ORDERED VIA PHONE 45 minutes ago, because she thought it would anger the other dine-in guests who have been waiting an hour for their meal. Nobody in line could believe what they were hearing. Only one person bringing food to very frustrated tables (she was the happiest and best employee in the place from what I could tell) - and people were getting annoyed by the fact they could see the guys in the kitchen...not in any rush to get orders moving, just joking around and drinking soda from pitchers. Way overpriced for average pizza and an establishment that has plenty of potential but an absolutely terrible way of doing business. This place is is a joke.  Won't be back.

The staff was rude. Our server cursed in front of my 6 and 4 year old. The manager could not have cared less and tried to lecture me. She said the server was new. I don't know what that had to do with anything. I paid full price so I don't get why that should effect me.

Great family place to go out to, just don't be a clean freak.  There is dirt and peanut shells on the floor but don't worry it's supposed to be there.  Yummy pizza and decent price plus great burgers.  I played video games with my son whale we waited.  I will be back for sure and try the Santa Pizza.

Over the years we have visited Klondike Pizza many times.  For whatever reason the service and quality has gone way down. During our most recent visit it took us near an hour to get our pizza and the place didn't seem that busy.  They had a stop sign up saying, 'wait to be seated' but we couldn't find anyone to seat us. They had one cashier and about 4 or 5 people in the back, I assume making pizzas?  I'm not so sure what was going on with the pizza sauce, it seemed overly sweet this time. I recall during our previous  visit before this one, after one hour we checked on our pizza and they forgot to make it.

It was fun to go in here after over twenty years away... the place still looks the same, and the pies still taste great! If you're looking for a fun, family friendly environment - Klondike is a great choice. The only real knock that I have is the pricing. A mini pizza and a beer cost me $20!! That's spendy!!

Crust is just crispy enough. No other oven baked pizzas compare!

Enjoy shelling eating peanut while you wait. Just throw the shells on the floor. We enjoyed the pineapple and ham pizza. A small was plenty for two people.

Came here on a Saturday evening at 4:30pm and it was only fairly busy. Enjoyed the peanuts for the appetizer while the kids play video games. Pizza was cooked nicely, and customer service was nice. By 6:00pm this place was very full. People were waiting long times and the staff was getting a bit hectic, by this time we were done and decided to get out as the line was getting longer. Overall, fun place to visit, peak hours get busy.       Nov 03, 2018                                                                                    by Lisa J.

Been to Klondike's many times over the years generally good service and food. This time it appears they may either have a new manager or just done some poor quick hiring. The young staff seating customers and bringing out food were informal rushed and impolite. One guy went to seat an elderly couple and told them \"if you want a table follow me\" the confused elderly couple slowly followed Our pizzas were brought out separately by a different guy who set down rusted plates then the pizza and walked away without a word. Didn't ask if we needed anything else. They weren't busy the dining room was maybe half full with small parties of people. If we get Klondike's again we will get it to go       Sep 29, 2018                                                                                    by Chantal H.    The pizza here is great and the staff is friendly. However I came here for all you can eat which is $10.75 per person and my fiancé and I sat in the back area near the arcades and we rarely had a server bring pizza around. We would watch the servers predominantly go to the other side of the restaurant while we waited to be served. Also one of the servers knew a group of people that were in our area and he would go straight to them each time and give them multiple slices of pizza when they already had some on their plates still. Very frustrating especially because we were very hungry.       Sep 25, 2018                                                                                    by Lynda P.    Delicious! Not sure why the negative reviews, but our service and pizza was excellent! The crust was just right! Crispy bottom, but soft top and lots of cheese and ingredients. Yes there's peanut shells and their dust on the floor, but that's part of the theme. I felt the establishment was very clean and would definitely come back again! As for high prices, we purchased a small Hawaiian and two drinks for $22 and it was plenty. The pizza was larger than the avg small, we had leftovers. At $11 per person that's about what you pay for bad fast food now.       Sep 12, 2018                                                                                    by Gregory Mundy    Holy wow!

Pizza was piled with lots of veggies their salad was plenty to fill you up very nice patio to sit outside enjoy the weather cool breeze.  Lots of little shops to walk to will definitely go back can't wait to go back they also had other food items but I will have to try over a few more visits lol sodas and tea are free refills and will definitely try other pizzas enough room to take a party of 15 people that's how roomy it is in the patio.

The all you can eat Tuesday has been getting worse over the years. There is always an abundance of the basic pizza available. So if your looking for cheese or pepperoni you shouldn't have a problem. But if you wait for pizzas with more toopings, you will be there for sometime waiting.

We visited on August 3, 2018. I stumbled upon this gem a few years ago (been going to Arroyo for years and never knew it was there) and it made it on the \"to-do\" list each visit.  Food was exceptional and will be back again. The ONLY thing I can say that must be improved is more staffing at the check in counter, 1 person taking orders on a Fri/Sat night just doesn't work. The line gets to long and I can honestly say people were leaving without ordering.  Same with the drink counter. Otherwise they have the staffing in order. See you in November!!!!

Typically the pizza hear is awesome, but unfortunately for user caught this place on a bad day. I've been coming here for over 25 years, & this pizza has been somewhat of a treat to get.  Today we ordered a couple of pizzas to be picked up. The people behind the counter were very nice & friendly. When our pies came out, the lady behind the counter opened the boxes & presumably checked our pizzas to make sure that they were correct. The toppings were correct, but to our dismay when we got home, we found it burnt. I figured that when the lady looked at our pizza she was checking for quality too, I was wrong. I get it that some days are better than others, but for the cooks AND the counter staff to believe this was acceptable is disappointing, especially for the price of the food.  It'll probably be a while before we come back, hopefully by then the staff will be putting a better product out then.

If this spot did not have significance to my family I would never return. The pizza is lackluster. Just kinda sucks really and it is insanely over priced for no reason really.       Jul 25, 2018                                                                                    by Taylor M.    It had been a while since coming in so a coworker and I went in on our lunch break. That was a mistake, they take forever, and it wasn't that busy. The girls behind the counter were less than friendly, hardly helpful and I'm not sure they knew how to smile. Our two mini pizza's and two salads took close to 40 minutes to come out, so by that time we had to ask for them to be boxed up. Once we got back to work i was super disappointed to find half of my pizza crust burnt and way more sauce than cheese or toppings...and my salad was a joke. It was literally lettuce thrown in a container. So for the quality and price, I don't think we'll go back.

I can't get enough hope they never close!       Jul 17, 2018                                                                                    by Jessica K    Pizza was okay but lacking flavor. There was a small woman who took our order who was not very kind. We received 2 pizzas and one was not what we ordered but the waitress was very apologetic and refunded us for the mistaken pizza. It was a neat environment and the gentleman who seated us was very kind and helpful!

Have been going and eating the pizza here for years and its one of our favorites, especially Tuesday nights and I am sad to say it won't happen any longer. First off how they manage the floor now is nothing short of ridiculous saying \" I will be your server\" and than spending more time on the other side of room than the one your serving!? and this has happen the last three times we've visited and than the blend of pizzas I don't prefer white sauce, but you get baraged with 8 in a row!? and the same with reds ten minutes later, come on mix it up!!!. And then the final straw was; seated at 6:55p. 7:15p no pizzas at all!!!!  7:30p still no pizzas, meltdown begins and finally lone knees knocking server expresses \"We have had a problem in our kitchen\" !!??? BUT I HAVE SEEN SEVERAL TO GO ORDERS FLYING OUT THE DOOR!. Manager has vanished all this time and I know this why? because she has a very distinct voice, almost shrills when she talks!!!! It has just become a huge drag going there and it's sad that the owner no longer gives two nickels about a place that was pretty dang good once. Wish I could a glowing review but alas the past is gone!       Jul 15, 2018                                                                                    by M L.    Lettuce on burger tasted terrible, meat burnt. bread tasteless. Kids say pizza was good, but don't buy minis for $14. two of those is less volume than the 14 inch and $8. more, but they wouldn't do 1/2s when sauce was different. Also, took an hour to get our order. After 45 min came to table to ask questions they should have asked when we ordered. Will never go again.

I've been coming here as well as the Santa Maria location for over 10 years. It's a charming place and the pizza is beyond fantastic. I don't know what their secret is but it makes me shiver with pure ecstasy with every bite.       Jul 11, 2018                                                                                    by J W.    We were in town and I wanted to get some pizza and it was scorching hot...on the coast? So Alaska themed sounded appealing! It was a surprise to feel crunchy dirt touch my foot as I stepped inside, but it was from a decade of throwing peanut shells on the floor. The prices seemed high at first but the make up for it with the quantity they give. But it's the QUALITY and service that are this restaurant's biggest issues. I ordered Hawaiian. The pizza tasted horrible, the crust was stiff and hard and the ranch was runny like liquid! I ordered water with our meal, but I had to go hunt down a worker 15 minutes later, who got it from behind the counter. Not a huge deal, but not anywhere near good service, especially on one of the hottest days of the summer. It was cool down there though, although the vibe with the peanut dirt floor felt unsanitary while I was eating. Maybe if the pizza had been good I wouldn't have noticed. I never leave pizza behind, but I did today.       Jul 09, 2018                                                                                    by Sloane W.    AwwwHadn't been to Klondike Pizza in a long time....wnet in the other day and was pleasantly surprised.  They have new management it seems...the pizza was good as always but the service has vastly improved from prior visits!! The new manager Tami visited oyr table and introduced herself...it was refreshing.  We will definitely be back.

Customer service rating would be in the negatives if it would be possible. Try to order it to go highly recommended! It all falls back on management!!! C'mon guys something must change.       Jul 02, 2018                                                                                    by Aurora Baron    Fun and unique place with good pizza. They offer you free peanuts and you toss the shells on the floor... tons of peanut shells. The Road Kill, their version of a meat lovers pizza and the Denali, their combination pizza are the best! Their garlic oil sauce is great to mix in with their ranch and red sauce. Great place in town.

Would get no stars but the pizza is good. Last year tried the Tuesday all you can eat. Terrrible service. Four of our group were vegetarians. No veggie pizzas where being delivered. After a 1/2 hour or so spoke to the lady manager asking for at least on veggie pizza. She said in essence what ever comes out of the kichen is what you get. No special orders.  Tonigh we ate in. Same awaful service.  Waited forever for our pizza.  Same lady manager gave us a lame excuse and said they are expediting our pizza. It took another 25 minutes to get the pizza.  People that were seated after us got their pizza first. As the manager delivered pizza to them she would not even look at our table or acknowledge us. How rude. No more Klondike Pizza for this family.       Jun 22, 2018                                                                                    by Gabriel B.    This place would get 4 or 5 stars but the service is brutal. After coming to the Tuesday night all you can eat as a family, and the service being terrible, we decided to just come in a regular night. It wasn't better.... We ordered salads and pizzas. They sent the salads to the wrong table. Then they sent one pizza to the wrong table and dropped one on the floor. They had to remake both. It already takes forever at this place but it really takes a long time when they need to remake everything. How can a place that makes such great pizza have such terrible service?  My guess is they don't care. That was our 5th and last time. Although I'm curious to know if they can also mess up to go orders.       Jun 13, 2018                                                                                    by Leto A.    Service was bad. We asked if they sold chicken and the response was rude, \" we don't sell anything fried.\" I'm passing by returning from beach and won't be back. Food was ok and over priced. Having family from Alaska we thought we should check this place out. Bad idea.

If you're craving a pizza and driving through on the 101 fwy from Central Coast.....This place is delish! Love the way they make their pizza where the cheese goes all the way off the crust so there isn't really a crust! Also it's the perfect thickness with just the right crunch on the bottom of the crust. We had a mushroom pepperoni zucchini and their Italians salad and it was really good!       May 22, 2018                                                                                    by Don P.    Holy Moses! You kidding me that I haven't done a review of Klondike's? Wifey and I have been coming here for over 20 years. Ahh...the stories! We had our first date here. What keeps us coming back here? Denali's with red sauce, ranch dressing, and being able to chuck yer peanuts on the floor. Good times. This place is quirky. The decor is Alaskan hoarder. Not many places on the Central Coast has an eating establishment with a moose head, automated piano, ski poles, flags, boxing gloves, and Christmas lights. That's only the beginning. The food is wonderful. It is a family pizza joint so you have to keep a certain perspective. We absolutely love their red sauce and the ranch salad dressing. We have tried their white sauce on All you Can Eat Tuesday but it doesn't compare to their red sauce. The usual pizza we order is their Denali's with red sauce which is their combo. If you want to sample all of their pizzas, come on Tuesdays as it's all you can eat for 8.99 for oldies and 5.99 for young'ins. I give it 5 stars as for its food and all the good times we've had here.

One of the pizza's should not have been served. After waiting for an hour it arrived so burned it was inedible. Am now going on half an hour for the replacement. We have lost our appetite. I did notice ours was not the only burned pizza being returned. Probably our last visit to Klondike Pizza. So sad.  Follow-up: Waited for over another hour for the replacement. Staff were very apologetic. Gave us a coupon for a free xtra large pizza. Don't know what was happening. Guess I'll return at least once to redeem the free pizza. I have no complaints about the dining room staff. They seemed very uncomfortable about the situation and apologized several times. Two hours a bit too long to wait for your pizza.

This is now my go to pizza place. I've been here a couple times now. The BEST Buffalo chicken pizza I've ever tried. All I can say is WOW. They are pricey BUT the mini here is more than enough for one person so it is well worth the cost. The ingredients are so fresh and delish. If your in the area and you like pizza Klondikes is a must. .       Apr 17, 2018                                                                                    by Nicholas H.    There manager has poor manger skills, too many people doing very very very little, pizza sucked, white sauce cheese pizza 4 times around? I'm alright this place is as bunk and dirty as it's floor       Apr 07, 2018                                                                                    by Brent Clavin    Klondike pizza is amazing! I have been to the Santa Maria location before, but this was my first time to the original location. It's a neat atmosphere where you get peanuts while you wait for your pizza, and you throw your shells on the floor. Personally, I love the roadkill on white (meat lover's-type special), and my wife likes the Denali on white (vegetarian-type special). We showed up around 5 pm on a Thursday, and there wasn't many people there at the time, so we only had to wait for the actual food to be made. I think it took about 10-15 minutes for the pizza to be made. The service was great, and the employees were extremely nice! We were there with my 18 month old boy and the employees had a high chair at the table ready and waiting for us.  There was also this nice little story about how the owners met. It was obviously a piece of fiction, but reading it was nice and helped pass the time. I wonder if they print these frequently with different stories. I'll have to go back and see if there's a new story!  It's a great place for a family, and a nice dinner out. I absolutely recommend it!       Apr 07, 2018                                                                                    by Jim S.    Still great. I remember when Pam & Mike opened. It was a hit then, and still awesome. Peanut shells on the floor. Stuffed moose head on the wall, next to the player piano. Mike & Pam moved to AG from Alaska, bringing the decor with them. I had a baked sub sandwich today. Tasty. Loaded with meat, cheese, veggies. The signature pizza is loaded with Reindeer Sausage (explain that to your kid who still buys into Santa). The sauce has a small bite to it. If you like garlic, treat yourself to a pie with their White Sauce. Best anywhere.       Apr 01, 2018                                                                                    by Crystal Wagener    All time favorite pizza.  Love the atmosphere family friendly environment.  Be prepared to wait, on a busy night it can be upwards of an hour to get your pizza.  But there are arcade games for the bigger kids,  and all you can eat peanuts till pizza arrives. But allergies be warned. Peanuts everywhere.       Mar 27, 2018                                                                                    by Gil S.

But 1-2 topping pizza was a saucy mess, no flavor. Their manager seemed to micromange the place and employees. At one point an employee asked to box our pizza. We told him that it was no problem and that if he gave us a box, we'd box it ourselves, to which he responded, \"I have to do it so I can squeeze it into the smallest box possible, these things cost way more money than you know.\"   don't think that's information or attitude that should be passed along to the customer. As we left, on the wall, we saw a cartoon drawing of the staff with a bright confederate flag. Yeah, it's gonna be a no from us dawg! Won't go back there again.       Mar 15, 2018                                                                                    by Brenda W.    We were the first to enter around 5 pm ordered our pizza, and sat down, the place started filling up and after 45 minutes I went to the counter to see where our pizza was and the lady said its on the counter, I just need to find someone to bring it to you. So after waiting some more we finally got out pizza as so did other people who had arrived much later than us. The pizza sucked, it was warm and soggy. Wont come back because after  telling the lady who seemed to be in charged how dissapointed we were, we got was a  sorry dont waste your time here if you wont fresh hot good pizza       Mar 14, 2018                                                                                    by Kathy F.    I love Klondike's  pizza and have for years.   But today at lunch the smell in the dining area is awful.   It's like a cross between cleaning fluid and something rotting.  I do wonder when the fabric(flags etc) from the ceiling was taken down an cleaned last?  Left with a nasty headache.    I think I'll get my pizza to go in the future.  The pizza was awesome as usual.

A pizza joint in a basement.  After waiting 40 minutes, no pizza.  Apparently 'dropped' according to the restaurant team.  A lovely worker by the name of Olivia came to the resue. She expedited our pizza and gave us salad. Super awesome service.  Great pizza too.       Feb 25, 2018                                                                                    by AJ Collins    Always a crowd favorite. My kids (and the adults) enjoy eating peanuts and tossing the shells on the ground. You will never run out of things to look at! ( It is a great location for an 'I Spy' game). The pizza crust is thick and chewy, while the sauce is just a tiny bit sweet. The cheese and other toppings taste fresh and not processed. The service is normally okay, sometimes a little slow because it is almost always busy. Bring your quarters, there are video games to play!!       Feb 23, 2018                                                                                    by bingsythingsy    What kind of pizza will you create? Such a warm small town joint with amazing pies. A must for any length of stay down in San Luis.       Feb 18, 2018                                                                                    by Richard M.    The only reason why im leaving 2 stars is because the quality of food is on point. The customer service the past 2 times i came here was horrible. Next time i get pizza from here i will get it to go! Customer service is VERY important to me and they have better service at McDonalds! I rarely have something negative to say and it takes a lot for me to write a bad review.       Feb 15, 2018                                                                                    by Jody Perez    Good old school pizzeria that never disappoints.  And a friendly, warm atmosphere to boot!  And the local, wandering roosters outside are an added bonus!  Yes, roosters galore!  'Ware!

Great cheese bread and a super cool place! This will be our new out of town spot!!

The white sauce is tasty and the meatlovers pizza (Roadkill) is a favorite. Fun family-friendly atmosphere. The shells from the peanuts they give you can be thrown right on the floor which is fun! The reason I gave 4 stars is that the staff is helpful and friendly but the wait time waiting for them to bring out your pizza is VERY long. Even on a night that was not very busy we waited an exceptionally long time for our salad and pizza to come. A busy night is one thing but the turn around time for the pizza needs to be quicker. I've come here for many years and it is usually a \"normal\" wait for your food but it has been quite a long wait the last few years.       Jan 27, 2018                                                                                    by Edwin Martinez    Great atmosphere, food,  prices, service and staff! Came in on a Friday night, it was really busy, had a small Hawaiian pizza, dinner salad and two root beers. It was more than enough food for two, leaving is with leftovers. Although there were lots of kids running around, thanks to all the signs, it was a pleasurable experience. Definitely worth the price, and the wait. The staff was very accommodating when we asked to move tables, to be in a warmer spot. We plan on coming back,  weekly!       Jan 24, 2018                                                                                    by Andy R.    We've been passing this restaurant promising to try it. Today is the day. Here are my impressions and food thoughts: 1.  Eclectic in a fun way. Peanuts and sawdust in the floors. Very 1980's retro. It was fun eating the peanuts awaiting my $7.99 lunch special:  Dinky Pizza & soda 2.  There is a small arcade with two pinball machines and several other amusement devices 3.  If you think you are going to get the real story about the restaurant \"founding\" and Klondike Alaska connection...dream on. On the tables and wall there are numerous \"Stories\". Each one is different and a fun read. I'm sure there is a kernel of truth in each one. Regardless, it adds to the uniqueness of the restaurant. 4.  My thoughts about the pizza. I liked the taste. BUT, (it's always the \"BUT\" in a sentence that takes away everything preceding it) the dough was dough-y. Frankly, it reminded me of a Roman frozen pizza not cooked enough. I informed the server but she wasn't very interested and you can tell that no one in the kitchen would ever know. Regardless, there are several things on the menu I want to try including raindeer sausage. I will update my review in the future. The restaurant is fun for those who are young and young at heart. A pleasant diversion if you are not rushed for lunch.       Jan 16, 2018                                                                                    by Jeremy F.    Ordered several to-go pizzas. The pizza was good. The ranch was really good.

Normally love toppings on my pizza but they've perfected the Cheese pizza. Peanut shells on the floor, arcade games, have been coming here for 20 years and it still excites me to come here.

We all rated this place as a family. A very fun place, lots if funny signs and everyone there was very friendly. Fast service for being a full house.

Wow this place is horrible in terms of customer service.  Came here for lunch with 3 of my co-workers.  It was around noon. The place only had 2 people when we arrived.  We ordered our lunch meals.  We sat and waited.  My 2 co-workers received their salad 20 min after and their pizza 30 min after.  My other co worker received her sandwich 35 min after and I received my sandwich 40 min after.  There was a customer that ordered about 10 min after we sat down and he received his meal before us.  The waitress claimed there were only 1 person working in the back.  The meals were okay.  We left pretty pissed off.  My boss left a suggestions card and hopefully this establishment reads it.  I will never come back at this place.

We walked into this place on the Friday after Thanksgiving knowing it would be busy and the wait would be awhile. I had no idea the wait would be one hour and twenty two minutes! We asked twice what the wait would be and no one would give us a straight answer. When our order was taken the girl told us it would be \"A long time\" which doesn't mean anything to me. It was so long we all began to joke about it. It seemed like no one had food and everyone in the place was getting restless. It was so forever that I walked around the place to see how many tables had received their food. 4/15 tables had pizza. Only four! Thank goodness for the peanuts or the whole restaurant woulda starved. The dude at the drink station, Caleb, was such a hot mess. The drink line was long. He seemed like he was having a constant battle with the ice machine. He was beating the ice down with a bat and just generally sucking at filling cups quickly. The place and employees made me somewhat uncomfortable. Other than Tarah, who was by miles the best employee there, all the other workers just seemed annoyed and short tempered. I asked the person I thought was the manager, Olivia, for some boxes and she looked at my face and walked off. Then she was gone long enough for me to wonder if she was getting me a box or just ignoring me. All their signs posted at this \"family restaurant\" are kinda mean about children. I get that parents need to watch their bratty kids but posting multiple signs about them seems too much. If it weren't for Tarah, who was professional, kind and attentive, I would have given only one star.

I will start by acknowledging that the pizza was quite good.  Unfortunately the customer service was so bad that it ruined our first and only experience at Klondike's. Our order consisted of 2 pizzas, 2 orders of garlic cheese bread, 4 sides of ranch dressing, and 4 sodas.  Should be easy.  We ordered and were seated.  Got our drinks and peanuts and waited.  I know good pizza takes a while and I was with my hubby and friends, so no problem.  Then one pizza shows up.  Another 5 minutes and the second one shows up.  How do they not serve both pizzas at one time?  More problematic - where is the garlic cheese bread and ranch?  Flagged down a server who looked flustered beyond belief and asked.  She brought the ranch and told us they were cutting the garlic bread ... it would be right out. 15 minutes.  Nothing. We ask again and get a different story.   15 minutes more.  Nothing.  A third story.  And now they ask if we still want it or if they should wrap it to go.  I ordered garlic cheese bread.  I want my order and I want to eat it at the restaurant.   Finally, my friend approaches a woman who appears to be managerial and gets the next lie about the order.  I think she lies so much that she doesn't know who she told what, because she finally brings the bread to the table and tells us a completely different lie than what she told my friend at the counter. At this point we are so disillusioned with the place we get a box and leave.  I have worked in restaurants.  Errors happen.  However you own it and fix it immediately.  If they had been honest with us, I could be understanding.  Nevertheless the attitude from the manager and the incompetence of the staff (which I see as a direct reflection on management) means that this was my first and last visit.

They have some different items that aren't run-of-the-mill: reindeer sausage (not Santa's, the menu specifies), chicken cordon bleu Pizza, etc. Service at the front counter was friendly and inviting. We arrived about 20 minutes before the dinner crowd. The problem is the kitchen. Our order includes two pizzas, two cheese breads, and 4 ranch. The pizzas came first, after about 45 minutes of waiting. We inquired about the ranch and cheese bread. We were told the bread was coming out of the oven and asked if we wanted the ranch now. The server brought the ranch and apologized for the pizza. 15 minutes later the story was the bread was being cut. 15 minutes again, and it was being boxed (we ordered for dine-in), another 15 minutes and it as now going in. The manager, while trying to be friendly offered 3 new excuses for why the bread wasn't done. Offered to refund if we didn't want it. When the bread came up, as I was speaking with her, she brought it to our table and gave a completely different excuse to the entire table as to why the bread was late. Overall, the food was decent, but the service ruined it. We won't be returning.

They are very generous with their toppings and their pizza crust is awesome. Their biggest problem is that they are often too full to get a table, so best to go at off hours. Free salted peanuts to munch on while you wait for your pizza to come out.       Nov 20, 2017                                                                                    by Katelyn Sweigart    My FAVORITE pizza place. The atmosphere is laid back, with peanut shells on the floor and bare beams covered in Christmas lights and bumper stickers. It has character up the wazoo with an Alaskan theme.

I have been going here for about 20 years now, and have never experienced a bad pizza from here. If anyone tells you to order anything besides the pizza, tell them they're crazy. Order pizza here, it is excellent. Sometimes the line can get long and it takes awhile to get your order in. So be smart, and call in, don't blame the place for being slow because its busy, that doesn't make sense. Don't pay attention to anything less than 4 stars for this place, those people don't know good food, OR we're already having a bad day and blamed everything on Klondike's. I've definitely had many many different pizzas in my life, Klondike's is undoubtably the best around!

I've been going here since I was very young.  Love the casual \"peanuts on the floor\" atmosphere. Great pizza.

Several custom pizza creations, salads, wine, beer you got it all.  Probably a little more expensive than the mainstream chains but well worth the price.

Love coming to Klondikes every time I'm in town! For some sweetness after a nice dinner, head across the street to Doc's for some incredible ice cream.

I loved the feel of the place and the staff was very upbeat!  Really cool place to come and eat pizza. Must try the Klondike pizza!! Will def come back again!!

My son and I are pizza lover's and we rate and compare all kinds of pizza places, especially one-off pizza places.   The pizza is 5 stars! The prices are high so I would have given a 4 star rating but the positives make up for the negative of high prices.

This pizza here is mind blowing to say the least! I couldn't have been happier with our experience here. Service was excellent, pizza was excellent and it had a real down home vibe. Two thumbs up for sure, another demand for an excellent Yelp review from my son who was in pure pizza heaven. Superb!

We went here with our friends from idaho, their were 7 of us, we ordered 3 pizzas all were delicious, we vould not eat it all and we were from out of town had no way of saving it. We offered the rest of it to a family, they excepted it. The manager approached me and asked what was going on. I explained to him we ordered too much and did not want to waste this delicious pizza. He was very understanding and seated the family who enjoyed the pizza. I highly recommend this pizza. The wait was long but worth it. Great customer service. Also I told the manager that I have never had riendeer before and he cooked our table a sample, delicious. Love this place I highly recommend it.

Waited to finish writing a previous ticket before even telling us she will be with us in a second. She could have at least said \"I'll be with you in one moment\" the pizza took about an hour to get to us but it was pretty packed in there so no complaining. Pizza was absolutely amazing.

Very good tasting pizza, though can be hit and miss (at least the Santa Maria one wasn't that great).  Though I do knock them off for the amount of time it takes to bring out the pizza.  Be prepared for a 20-30 minute wait.  First time I was there it was about 20 minutes, fairly busy (so I didn't think much of it). Second time I was there I was told a 30 minute wait (I needed to be somewhere, but need to bring the food, so i said okay since they'd said they'd tried to rush it through. Came back 25 minutes later and from the conversation, they never even started on the pizza, since the cashier scolded the pizza makers to start on it now.  Said 10 minutes.  Came back 10 minutes later and still it wasn't ready until 5-7 minutes later.  The pizza was delicious though (veggie x-large, with garlic sauce)       Jun 12, 2017                                                                                    by Joan Costamza    Garlic , pineapple, chickin & white sauce pizza M M M M M M GOOD !

There pizza is awesome but there time frame and Service older later taking the money (everyone else was great) was horrible!! Ordered pizza to go at 615 they said 35-45 min so I arrive at 655 and they said pizza will be ready in 15 -20min I was like what happen? She said we got busy so I guess eating in take priority we'll anyway I ended up getting my pizza at 741 so from 35-45min finish time it didn't finish for 1hr and 25 mins that's over double and not even a sorry one of the people were eating with had to take it to go because it took so long and they were running late and not even a sorry for the delay or anything! And to top it off it wasn't even busy in there       Apr 30, 2017                                                                                    by Marissa M.    This place is great#!I have my kids birthday parties here. It feels more like a family atmosphere. Abd the food great##       Apr 25, 2017                                                                                    by Bernie W.    Went on Tuesday night to try out \"20 pizzas\" brought out (randomly) by the slice. It was a significant wait between slices, but that (as it turns) was a good thing. Sincerely, I've had better frozen pizzas. This is not good pizza. Had a good experience, other than the food. I haven't read the other reviews but did see the 4-star rating. I'm perplexed. This pizza is quite bad.  Go in to SLO and get a pie somewhere. Two stars for the concept and smiles.

A High school friend made a post about this place a couple weeks ago. Craving pizza so gave this place a try. Tried the small Denali w a friend. This was back in July 2016       Mar 28, 2017                                                                                    by Sarah C. M    Tasty pizza, all you can eat on Tuesdays. Unlimited salad on Tuesdays as well. Lovely servers and fun atmosphere.       Mar 16, 2017                                                                                    by Back P.    If I could give zero stars, I would. 10 years ago, Klondike Pizza kicked me and my partner out of their restaurant for being lesbians! We were told that they were a \"family\" restaurant. We hadn't been demonstrative either. I think we just touched hands for a second. In addition, we had to pay our bill even though we didn't get to take home our leftovers or finish our dinner. I now wish I hadn't paid our bill. We told all of our friends & co-workers about the above story and they've never returned to Klondike either. I'm writing this now, as I never got over the discrimination this restaurant did to us!!! I hope they've opened their minds in the past 10 years!       Feb 28, 2017                                                                                    by Jill Mckenna    The service is outstanding! The management works just as hard as the staff and they have great communication and incredible team work!       Feb 21, 2017                                                                                    by Amyy S.    5 stars for the crew . The team they have is absolutely amazing (despite the horrible lady who thinks she is in charge) The kids working have the BEST Personalities. Oh Especially Nate , a younger gentleman working their - he deserve a raise and a higher title . His friendly smile is awesome , but it's his funny demeanor that really drawls you in- while keeping it professional of course . We ate there on all you can eat buffet night - busy , crazy , loud and a lot of fun. The owner is very heartfelt and a local - he's the sweetest if you get a chance to talk with him   Ps : don't eat the garlic bread on all you can eat night , that's how you get full !!       Feb 17, 2017                                                                                    by Derek Klemm    Wonderful pizza with a fun atmosphere. They give you peanuts while you wait and you throw the shells on the diet floor when you are done; trust me, it's encouraged! They also have an arcade game area to pass the time. Highly recommend.       Feb 12, 2017                                                                                    by Elizabeth R.    love, love, love this place. it is so delicious!! The lines are usually a bit long, but that's because the pizza is popular. The only thing I wish they would do is have a separate pickup counter...ordering ahead of time saves the cooking time, but you still spend a while standing in line.       Feb 04, 2017                                                                                    by Tabitha D.    This is an Arroyo Grande Classic! The food is delicious and the atmosphere is fun. The lighting is a little dim. There are games available, I recommend pac man, because who doesn't love that. I am a classic girl and usually order the same thing every time I go. But my family is a big fan of the meat lovers and Hawaiian style pizza. When you finish head over across the street to Docs for dessert.       Jan 30, 2017                                                                                    by Robert D.    I had heard great things about Klondike's pizza, and it too, did not disappoint. The atmosphere was great, the food was great, and they even gave you free peanuts to eat and throw the shells on the floor! The food was a little bit pricy, but being at the beach I would expect it to be a bit more expensive. Paid with a 100$ bill, and received a bunch of small bills, so I asked if I could give her some change and recieve a larger bill instead. The waitress told me that she already counted out and basically didn't want to go do the math again. Kind of irritated me, but otherwise a great experience!!       Jan 26, 2017                                                                                    by Chad Forrester    The pizza is good and the atmosphere is fun (but noisy). This place is fairly popular, so be prepared to wait if you are going around normal meal times.       Jan 22, 2017                                                                                    by Tabitha S.    Customer since the 90's. Denali on white sauce or the Veggie on red are my go to pizzas. Great family environment. Highly recommend!       Jan 21, 2017                                                                                    by Randy R.    Recently had lunch there on a Monday holiday. Got there just before lunch. We ordered 2 medium pizzas, a Road Kill & a Hawaiian, along with salads. We were told to have a seat anywhere, except at the reserved tables due to a party. Our food was brought out in a timely manner. The party( birthday ) had about 12 ladies, staff came and took their orders at their table. Also a number of families showed up. Staff assisted with getting high chairs for little ones. I thought the pizzas were good, did not skimp on toppings. The Hawaiian was better than most I have eaten. The decor is interesting & funny. There are games for the kids & adults.The staff on our visit was excellent, not only for us. But also for those around us. My wife and I visit central coast on a regular basis, and will visit this location again.       Jan 17, 2017                                                                                    by April G.    This place is great for bringing your kids and sending them to the little arcade while you wait for your food! There are also card games, books, and mags by the soda pick up. We've been coming for several years, sometimes pizza is fast, sometimes you might wait for an hour and a half, you never know. We just come early and before we're starving and it doesn't matter. We're not really pizza eaters, we mostly come for the fun, but the pizza is fine; thin crust, lots of cheese. If you get a salad get the dressing on the side unless you like it drowned. Oh, don't go on Tuesday night unless you hate yourself or maybe you gave up your sanity for lent; it's a gorgefest madhouse down there.       Jan 12, 2017                                                                                    by Dave J.    Really good pizza, my wife thinks it's the best ever! Nice atmosphere, but could use updated games in the arcade, service is slower than I would like and pizza is more on the expensive side.       Jan 08, 2017                                                                                    by Pismo T.    Fabulous pizza located in quaint downtown Arroyo Grande. Favorite pizza is the Denali! Fun atmosphere! Play a board game while you eat peanuts at your table! Staff is friendly and competent! Great for parties or large groups! Tuesday nights are super busy, all-you-can-eat night. If you or someone in your group is allergic to peanuts, this is NOT the place for you!! Peanut shells cover the floors, is part of the ambiance.       Jan 07, 2017                                                                                    by Robert H.    This place is the bomb. Got a pepperoni with extra red sauce and it was perfect. Nicole helped me and she was great! I would write more but the pin ball machine is calling my name.       Jan 04, 2017                                                                                    by Krysten E.    This is honestly the best pizza I have ever eaten! Perfect amount of sauce, toppings and cheese cooked just right! Since we moved from the area, we make it a point to go every time we come back in town for a visit to stop and eat here. We usually get half pepperoni and half Hawaiian on white sauce...DELICIOUS! On Tuesdays they do have all you can eat night which can tend to get super busy, so if you're wanting to beat the crowd, get there early. It is super kid friendly. There is dirt on the floor and it is a place where you eat peanuts while you wait and the shells can go on the floor. I do wish the soda fountain station was where you could give yourself refills, but I understand why it is behind the counter too. The restaurant is in a basement, so there are no windows, but I love the setup. It kind of has an Alaska feel to it and there are light strands hanging from the ceiling. We did go on a Sunday night (I believe, may need to call and ask), and it was super fun! It was sing along night and the guy plays the piano, everyone gets a book of lyrics so everyone can participate! Hope you like it as much as we do!

If you come for all you can eat Tuesday I suggest you not eat all day and come early. Oh and just in case you were wondering...The crust is whole wheat! Shhhh, don't tell anyone they are getting a healthier dough. It tastes so damn good I don't know why anyone would care but I guess some do.  Final score: Get here ASAP and ASOP.

Dec 05, 2016                                                                                    by Avery W.    Hella good pizza. We got a pizza I think was called The Diablo. Awesome, filled with toppings and was very filling. Came here with 8 people and it was not a problem getting seated. Parking sucked and I got a ticket for making a left hand turn leaving this place. I like The Village but it can be a pain around lunch and parking totally sucks. Seriously though, get a self serve soda machine.       Nov 30, 2016                                                                                    by Stephanie L.    It feels like I stepped into the Northern Exposure episode. Plaid table cloths, teenage cute employees, hot and fresh pizza, Alaska memorabilia galore from top to floor decorations. It's a feast for the eyes and stomach. There was a line since the Christmas parade was in progress. I got a glass of the Prohibition Red wine, $5, and my friend got the Alaskan Pale Ale beer. We got a small pizza. Half vegetarian and half pepperoni with a choice of red or garlic sauce. We opted for the red sauce. We paid and we get a number for the pizza to be served at our table. We get a basket of roasted, salted peanuts which we can toss the shells on the floor. The alcohol we get from a separate counter. There are a lot of families and kids. Its a nice place to relax where the families could be noisy and get a hearty meal.       Nov 27, 2016                                                                                    by Jeff K.    We recently took a trip to Alaska and were complaining to a friend about the mediocre Pizza in SLO County. She recommended Klondike and said it had that Alaska flavor. I was pleasantly surprised with their pizza. It does taste like pizza in Alaska! Outstanding. Be advised that this place encourages fundraisers and can be incredibly busy, even without a fundraiser going on. We waited longer than usual; but it was worth the wait. Great crust, good fillings and reasonable prices. You order; they deliver so service isn't much of an issue. The atmosphere is very lively and fun with peanut shells on the floor. Oh, the peanuts are pretty good to start of as an appetizer of sorts. This is worth a try!       Nov 11, 2016                                                                                    by Sherrie G.    We ordered the Denali and the sauce and ingredients were the freshest we have ever had. Great price for a top quality pizza. This is coming from a couple who is serious about their pizza! We got it to go and had a 20 min drive. Just imagine if we would have ate it there with a frosty beer. I also ordered a simple salad with veggies and was impressed. Home made tasting ranch!       Nov 05, 2016                                                                                    by Sharon S.    Always good pizza! Great selection of toppings. I have found that the leftovers don't freeze well - do not taste all that good. Staff are always nice. I really wish they would dust the place. They have t-shirts hanging from the walls that have never been cleaned. There is little air circulation in there. Be prepared to wait for your pizza. I appreciate the peanuts they give you at your table. Nice that we can just drop the shells on the floor :) Cute arcade for kids as they wait for the pizza to be made. You end up spending more than you expected for lunch once the game playing begins. There is a coin machine if needed.       Oct 14, 2016                                                                                    by Jackie H.    We were there with a group of 22 and there was a large group of 22 ahead of us on a Tuesday, all you can eat night.  It took forever to pay as they has 1 cashier and everyone in the group ahead of us paid separately and with 1 cashier it took forever.  Overall the pizza was good, but a couple of us got very sick the next day...  Diarrhea!!  not fun...We did enjoy the atmosphere as we have been to Alaska.       Oct 03, 2016                                                                                    by Kyle Field    Tasty non-chain pizza that really hits the spot with an atmosphere that can't be beat.  I've been coming here for decades and absolutely love the place to this day.  The pizza here can't be beat. Hand made with lots of love and plenty of high quality toppings that all work together to make a pizza that is at the top of my best pizza list. 5 stars just for the pizza.  The atmosphere here is classic with Alaskan themed accessories and decor that give it a truly unique personality. On top of that, the floor is covered with peanut shells...and there are free peanuts to eat which make for great appetizers for the kids while the pizza is being made. I used to dig around through the peanut shells for lost quarters for the arcade games (hah!).       Sep 18, 2016                                                                                    by Renee C.    We stopped in Arroyo Grande to have a steak; however, when we passed my Klondike and smelled the pizza. We had to change our mind. Cute family restaurant where you can play ping ball machines or pick a family game to play at your table. One of the best parts is you get to eat peanuts and drop the shells on the floor. The pizza what can I say. I am the mother of three teenagers so I know pizza. We made our own. Cheese with red sauce topped with mushrooms, black olives, tomatoes and ham. It was fantastic, crust not to thin or thick and crispy! I had limp crust. We ordered a small (which says for 2). We reheated half the pie at our hotel the next night to try to finish the pizza. Even great the second night! Will be back with the teens next trip!       Sep 04, 2016                                                                                    by Georgia W.    Literally nestled in the hole of a wall, Klondike Pizza is a hidden gem. Upon arriving, you are happily greeted by the young team, and are prompted to order at the front and then seat yourself. My boyfriend and I decided on a 14\" Garlic Chicken Pizza, made with white sauce, and had to pay extra for ranch and buffalo sauce for dipping, and with two beers (Bud Light and 805) also added to our check, we paid in total about $34.04. While the prices may seem a little steep, the ambience of the dining room is eccentric and unique. You enjoy a basket of peanuts while waiting for your food to arrive, and are encouraged to toss the shells on the hay-ridden floor. I would recommend this restaurant to all of those who enjoy a good pizza, and are interested in broadening your culinary horizons (they make a pizza made with Reindeer meat!)       Aug 12, 2016                                                                                    by Sara M.    Went to Klondikes tonight. We figured it would be quite busy on a Friday evening. There was a 45 min wait for pizza...which ended up being an hour. Not a big deal. What really sucked was the \"hostess\" or whatever the proper name is of the person who seats you. Karina was very unfriendly to me and my kids. Even they felt her rudeness. After an hour of waiting and a rude person we had pretty much lost our appetite. We ate one piece of pizza and left. On the bright side...the girl we refilled our drinks was very friendly.       Aug 09, 2016                                                                                    by John A.    The staff is always nice.  The quality is good. My advice is to let them know to go light on the cheese.  Otherwise, there's so much, it's obscene.       Jul 26, 2016                                                                                    by Tiffanie C.    A great unique experience!  Fun names given by hostess when checking in, awesome names of pizzas (road kill, Denali, and Klondike just to name a few) and the ability to throw your peanut shells on the ground without being frowned upon! Overall, it was a dining experience I will never forget. Ambiance, food, and service were ON POINT ALL THE WAY!       Jul 24, 2016                                                                                    by Christian    Great atmosphere and food!       Jul 16, 2016                                                                                    by Ed C.    Fantastic Pizza. The staff is very friendly and the pizza is great. The downstairs location makes it kind of hidden from the main street. This would be a five star rating if the wait to get the pizza was just a bit shorter and the restaurant was just a bit less \"closed\" feeling from being in the basement.       Jul 09, 2016                                                                                    by Ron W.    Fun quirky place to go to if you like having a good time throwing peanut shells on the floor and lots of knick-knacks this is a great place to go the pizza is very good thinner crust than many places a very good tomato-based sauce and service is very good       Jul 07, 2016                                                                                    by Donald Scott    By far the best pizza, and the best pizza experience this side of Moose's in Kalispell, Montana.  I always take out of town guests to Klondike, for the fine food, great atmosphere, and the wonderful service.

This is a unique place I have to say but I loved it the pizza here is delicious and the whole peanut thing was something else but I enjoyed me some peanuts I had the Hawaiian pizza and it's really good my hubby had the roadkill pizza and that was also good and not to mention the garlic bread pretty good I really enjoyed the sing a long which is on the first and third Saturday's of the month from 6:30 to 9 this was something totally different from my comfort zone but I love the experience       Jul 02, 2016                                                                                    by Bill G.    Amazing pizza!!! On the upper end of what I'm willing to pay for a pie, but amazing taste and good size. Great service every time we go. There is an all you can eat pizza on Tuesday that is really fun if you want to try new things. Great atmosphere for kids and plenty of fun things to keep them entertained!

Pepperoni is flavorful. Love that there is a smattering of cheddar cheese on the pizza too. Good price on pitchers of beer. Little arcade for kids to play in. Nice atmosphere. Service is really nice polite young staff. Look forward to coming back. UPDATE: Loved the pizza so much we came back for our final night to grab a pepperoni to go. SAD! 1st time not eating in. Pizza was suppose to be double pepperoni. I guess they weren't as generous tonight. Also asked for toasted. Not. Sad job tonight but not everyone hits a home run. I'll give them another chance.

Best pizza around!  Pricey but worth it.  We usually order to go but nice rustic family atmosphere where you can eat peanuts and throw them on the ground.

I didn't think i would like this place, but i left with a new favorite pizza joint for when the family and I  are over at the coast. We had the road kill with Garlic sauce and it was delicious. We also had a Hawaiian pizza and a pepperoni and olive and they were all fantastic. All in all this was a great family fun pizza place.

Been by a few times when we feel like talking a long ride.       Jun 07, 2016                                                                                    by Bella C.    So I came here with my friends to indulge in the all you can eat pizza. After a 45 minute wait we finally get our table. I'm so excited to start eating when... No vegetarian pizzas. I wait 25 minutes to even get one slice I could eat. The pizza was amazing don't get my wrong but the fact I could eat 1 out of every 5 pizzas that came around, not cool.       Jun 02, 2016                                                                                    by Diane A.    Great pizza! It's a little pricey, but you get what you pay for. The Tuesday night all you can eat is a bit of a hot mess, but worth it if you are willing to eat any kind of pizza and wait a long time. We order the pizza and pick it up to go quite a bit. Worth every penny.       May 30, 2016                                                                                    by Andrew O.    This place has a great atmosphere and I loved the salted peanuts. We got a half bacon/half sausage pineapple pizza and our daughter got a personal black olive pizza with the garlic sauce. I tried her pizza and I thought that the bacon and sausage were both good and the black olive pizza was good too that I tried a piece of. It was a crispy bottomed crust and was a thicker style, but chewy in the middle and good. I would definitely come here again when we visit the area.

The customer service was outstanding. Very friendly staff. Very nicely setup love the reasoning behind the restaurant. Very authentic decorations. Very family orientated. Will be back again.

The girl who took our order and made our drinks however, was more interested on trying to impress a boy at the counter than helping us. Very rude. Rolled her eyes. It was unnecessary and annoying. We come by every year on Spring Break, and we'll be sure to come again!       Mar 30, 2016                                                                                    by Mike G.

Tried this spot for the first time the other day cuz We heard a pal of ours might be coming to manage here.  We come to AG/Pismo all the time and cant believe we have never been here.  Was so good the other night we came for lunch the next day. We are foodies and appreciate good service and hard work. Pizza was great...lunch was great...service was great! Excited to come back especially if these folks bring our buddy in to run it...he will take this cool spot to an even better level.  (Sorry for the shameless plug). Try it either way..its awesome..we will be back!       Feb 22, 2016                                                                                    by C. M.    Just can't go wrong with Klondikes when the craving for really good pizza hits.  We had the roadkill today it was delicious.  We really like that the sauce is so good and stands out even underneath all of those yummy meaty toppings!  The pizza is pricy, but you get what you pay for and here you're paying for pizza perfection!! Plus, It brings back memories of being a kid and coming for the AYCE pizza nights!  Wish we lived closer so that could still enjoy that!  The peanuts, decor, piano and even the pinball is pretty nostalgic for me.  My softball team pic from the 90's is still hanging in the hallway!

Toppings are plentiful and quality ingredients. Worth the trip.       Feb 12, 2016                                                                                    by C H.    First off, if you're pizza particular, this may not be the best place for you. The pies are pretty simplistic-- meat, veggies, cheese. That being said, it's the atmosphere that really pushes Klondike's from being an ordinary pizza joint to a local institution. The zany Alaskan tchotchkes that line the walls, along with the peanut shell strewn floor make this place unforgettable, and the classic arcade games give it a nostalgic vibe that both children and adults alike can appreciate. Word of the wise: if you want to check this place out for the first time and really get a feel for it, as well as try multiple pizzas, stop in on Tuesday nights where you can get all you can eat pizza for roughly $10. So all in all, not the best pizza in town, but the friendly, energetic staff and fun atmosphere makes this place a must visit the next time you're passing though little ol' Arroyo Grande.       Feb 11, 2016                                                                                    by Jenna W.    Klondike has definitely grown on me. The pizza is reeeaallly good- especially when it's hot and right out of the oven. Tonight, the boyfriend and I went there and there was a slight miscommunication with the order. We  thought we ordered a medium- and received a mini. We didn't even look at the receipt- but we were charged for a mini. Cole took such great care of us! He just threw in another pizza while we enjoyed the mini. He DID NOT have to do that. We tried multiple times to pay the difference, but he wouldn't hear of it. We are Arroyo Grande natives now- and love knowing we can count on the pizza and the customer service EVERY time. Thanks Cole and Klondike!! We are lifers now!

Been wanting to go here for awhile.  Wife and I just felt like pizza, pretty rare for us!  Small size was more than enough. Pizza was great, fresh toppings. Also had a dinner salad. Love the casual atmosphere and played pinball after dinner. We'll be back! Even brought home leftovers...       Jan 30, 2016                                                                                    by Byron T.    I love this place! Growing up as a kid coming here for sport ceremonies. I continue coming here. For the nostalgia but mainly for the pizza because it's great. They have an all you can eat night on Tuesday which is good. You can't care what pizza you eat otherwise you may not get your money's worth. I usually don't eat vegetarian \n"

St. Angelo’s Celebrates National Pizza Month!      04  Oct 2017    by Editor  0 Comments   Like this   Tweet this     Tags   National Pizza Month , October , pizza   Category   Blog     Likes     Did you know that October is National Pizza Month? At St. Angelo’s Pizza , we want you to celebrate the occasion and learn about the history behind the pie. Read on to learn how this delicious staple came to be America’s go-to.   History of National Pizza Month  During World War II, soldiers that fought in Italy wanted to eat pizza when they returned to the United States. The popularity of pizza led many to start their own business. In 1984, Gerry Darnell, the man who founded the magazine Pizza Today , started National Pizza month. He owned a pizza restaurant and realized there were no trade magazines for the industry. This is when he decided to create Pizza Today and declare October National Pizza Month.  National Pizza Month is observed in the United States and Canada, and many restaurants feature special promotions during this holiday. There are over 63,000 pizza restaurants in the United States. Over 94 percent of consumers eat pizza at least once a month, and it is approximated that you will eat 6,000 slices of pizza in your lifetime (we think this is a little low, but that’s just us).   Interesting Facts About Pizza  We all love pizza, but did you know these interesting facts?   Pizza was first sold in the major cities such as New York, New Haven, Boston, and Trenton, and all of which had Italian American immigrants living there.  The famous Chicago deep dish pizza was created in 1943 by the restaurant owner who created Pizzeria Uno .  The restaurant chain Domino’s® was created by Tom Monaghan. This chain dropped its 30-minute delivery policy in some locations due to lawsuits that said the company promoted unsafe driving.  In 1962, the first frozen pizza was created, and consumers said it tasted like cardboard.  Pizza around the world features many unique toppings. The French love fried eggs, while Brazil uses peas and China tops it off with mini hot dogs.  Many famous actors got their start in the pizza business. Some of which include Bill Murray, Claude Van Damme, and Stephen Baldwin.  A pizza superhero movie was made in 2011 called Pizza Man .  Visit the Pizza Museum in Philadelphia, called Pizza Brain . It includes the largest collection of pizza mementos.   Celebrate with St. Angelo’s  We love National Pizza Month, but we feel that EVERY month should be pizza month! That’s why we are so excited to introduce our new Pizza of the Month promotion, featuring one of our large specialty pies \n",

Or is it about a bunch of people called Hugo?  Well despite the grammar complexity Hugos at Manly is worth a visit.   Hugos is on Manly Wharf, with views across to the harbour-side beach, looking towards the west.   And then looking to the south, you can watch the ferries arrive from the city.    What a setting for a meal!  The breezes blow through the open windows beautifully.  Perfect place for sipping cocktails and whiling away the time.  This one’s made with gin, apple liquor, lemon, mint and cucumber.   Refreshing for a warm summer’s day.  Then the pizza arrives.  The wild mushroom one, with taleggio, goat’s curd and caramelised onions.   Lovely, rich-tasting mushrooms.  On another day we shared an artichoke pizza, with pancetta, chicory, taleggio, chilli and lemon.   Also a good pizza.  And here’s another pizza we shared.  The puttanesca, with anchovies, capers, olives, tomato, oregano, and a hint of chilli.   As you can see, the pizzas at Hugos are very good.  The crust is crispy and fine, just enough to hold the topping and balance out the flavours.  Watching the meals arrive at other tables, all of the food there looks good, Italian-styled food.  Some dishes I’d like to try include:   The tasting plate: four natural oysters, fried calamari, fig salad & Italian meatballs  Crispy skin barramundi with grilled eggplant, roasted beetroot, saffron fennel and a caviar dressing  \n",

At first I was scared that I was eating yogurt that had turned, but sadly, I know what that tastes like and this wasn’t it. This was just a creamy, ever-so-slightly acidic contrast to the richness of Gruyere, leek and mushroom pizza.  If you don’t have Greek/Balkan/Mediterranean-style yogurt, you can get the same effect by straining regular yogurt through cheese cloth for 30-45 minutes in the fridge. Just set the cheese cloth in a strainer that’s sitting over a bowl, and use full fat yogurt.  I imagine this tastes just as good on soup \n",

It only means that you will get to eat from the pizza first, it doesn't necessarily mean that you will finish it on your own. In Spanish we simply say: Yo primero.

Nipnip ,  Sep 25, 2018     #8              Rodal  Senior Member       Seattle WA     Castellano (Chile)          Thank you Nipnip, the link you shared was very helpful. According to the link, getting first dibs implies there should be second dibs, and basically how ever many dibs as there are people in a group except for the last one, i.e. 49 dibs in a group of 50. It's not common but technically possible. I wonder why the last one doesn't get any dibs.  So in a group of two, only one person gets dibs like in the example of the wife calling first dibs on using the bathroom; the husband called 2nd dibs and the wife said: \"sorry you can't, there is only first dibs\". The husband's response to his wife was: well if if there is only first dibs then it should be: \"I call dibs\" not \"first dibs\". (good point). I conclude it would only be possible to call first dibs on something in a group of 3 or more people. Is this correct?

The number of people involved matters not. Actually, claiming dibs MEANS one wants to go first, to choose first -between 2 people, or among a throng. The word first is superfluous, redundant: it's like saying first winner. If you like, I can elaborate on the pizza example for which dibs doesn't make much sense to me; but, I usually resist critiquing the original.

OK, this changes things a bit, I claim first dibs on the pizza because I want to go first, the number of people matters not. The adverb first is superfluous and does not matter either. ¿Cómo lo diríamos en español entonces?

Ok, I'll begin by noting the good example provided by blueglaze in post #3: \"Dibs on which movie we watch tonight\". Note not needing/using \"first\", and that there is a choice among options. The dibs on \"that pizza\" makes sense if there are other things to eat, or other pizzas to choose among, and one calls or claims the right to the or that pizza -whether the pizza-dibs person selects first or not; that is, others can select what they want in whatever order, but \"that pizza\" has been claimed. If, on the other hand, there is nothing but \"that (one) pizza\" to eat, then it just seems selfish to claim the first slice (does it matter?), or worse, the only thing to eat. It would make sense if there is a pizza with several slices, each with different ingredients, and you claim dibs on first selection so you could pick which slice among the options, as with which movie among the options. BTW, sequential dibs would make sense, if there are three or more people and someone wants to be second/next in selecting the slice they like.  On the bathroom example with a couple/pareja, dibs would make sense if there are 2 or more bath options, and you claim dibs on the downstairs or closest one, for example. Otherwise, you'd just say \"first -or something like that- for (use of) the bathroom\". But, logically, that bathroom will still be there for the other or next person, whereas, that pizza will not.

Carl's Jr. also serves Bacon Ranch Fries, Bacon Cheddar Fries and Chili Cheese Fries, as well as poutine in Canadian locations. While the fast-food mashup trend has slowed in recent months, the Pepperoni Pizza Fries follow in the tradition of Carl's Jr.'s biscuit-doughnut hybrid Bisnut , Taco Bell's Waffle Taco and Burger King's Poutine a la Burger .

Last week I made this wonderful cheesy hot Pizza Dip for my family to kick off of the NBA Playoffs and it was a HUGE hit!!  At our house Friday night is synonymous with PIZZA night!  It is tradition and my boys hold me to it.  If for some reason we have an event or something on Friday night, they think we have to have pizza on Saturday or Sunday night–it is a must for every weekend, in their minds.  My boys are crazy about pizza.  I have gotten creative over the years with our pizza night, with these Pizza Twists, Pizza Rolls , Stromboli and now we have even had pizza in a bowl with this fun Pizza Dip!  I used mini pepperonis, just for fun, but I think regular sized ones would be great too.  My boys are kind of boring with their pizza—only cheese and pepperoni, but I think this recipe would be awesome with sliced black olives, sweet bell peppers, any of your favorite toppings sprinkled on top.  Also, I used Victoria brand marinara sauce.  Have you ever heard of that brand?  I get it at Costco (and I have seen it in my local grocery store) and it is FANTASTIC.  I think the sauce makes a big difference–so use your favorite for one for this dip.  If you feel like making your own sauce, I bet the 5 minute Marinara Sauce or this authentic Italian Red Sauce would also be great! I hope you enjoy this cheesy fun dip as much as we did!  Have a great weekend!  xoxoxo  PS  This reminds me of my personal favorite dip Hot Caprese Dip …oh yum! Have you tried that one yet?  I am looking forward to having garden fresh cherry tomatoes and basil this summer that makes the Caprese dip so incredible!!     Save  Print   Hot Pizza Dip            Ingredients   8 ounce block of cream cheese,softened (lite or regular)  1 teaspoon Italan Seasoning  ½ teaspoon garlic powder  1½ cups grated mozzarella cheese, divided (3/4 cup + ¾ cup)  ½ cup finely grated parmesan cheese, divided (1/2 cup + ½ cup)  1 heaping cup pizza sauce (or your favorite marinara or red sauce)  pepperoni slices, or other favorite pizza toppings** see note below   Serving Suggestions – toasted baugette slices, breadsticks, pita chips, crackers, or even tortilla chips       Instructions   Preheat oven to 375F. Spray a 9-inch pie dish (I used a stoneware one) with cooking spray.  In a bowl combine softened cream cheese and Italian seasoning and garlic powder.  Spread the prepared cream cheese mixture over the base of the pie dish.  Sprinkle ¾ cup mozzarella( or Italian blend) and ¼ cup parmesan cheese over cream cheese.  Spread a heaping cup of the pizza sauce to cover cheese (use more or less sauce according to your preference)  Cover the sauce with the remaining ¾ cup mozzarella and ¼ cup parmesan cheese.  Evenly top with pepperoni slices \n",

It’s an American favorite. My mom used to take me to eat pizza probably once a week. When I realized I had issues with grains, I made a Grain-Free & Primal Pizza Crust Recipe.   When I first started Paleo, people asked me what I missed most, and I would say, “PIZZA!” I grew up eating pizza quite often, and when I started eating healthier I realized me and pizza were not friends. Actually I don’t know many people that feel great after eating pizza. So that’s where this recipe comes in!  Unlike gluten-free crusts you may find at the store, this crust is actually GRAIN free too- meaning no rice or other starchy grains. Instead we use cauliflower and cheese. If you can tolerate dairy, want to indulge, but don’t want an upset stomach from a grain overdose, this recipe was made for you.      Grain-Free Primal Pizza  2013-06-19 20:25:45   Serves 2          Write a review   Save Recipe  Print       Ingredients   1 cup cooked, riced cauliflower  1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese  1 egg, beaten  2 teaspoons of Italian seasoning (or oregano, garlic, garlic salt)  Olive oil  Toppings- pizza sauce, shredded cheese, \n",

We all remember how we used to take lunchables to school as a kid. But now that some of us may be older the art of making it may have disappeared.          Steps          1   Open the box of Pizza lunchables. Remove the cardboard with either your hands or with scissors then peel off the plastic carefully starting at a corner.          2   Take a crust out from the box. Choose how many pizzas you want to make depending on how hungry you are.         3   Find the pizza sauce and rip the top across the dotted line. Carefully tear the sauce packet open with your hands across the dotted line or use a pair of scissors.         4   Pour some of the sauce on one pizza crust. Apply pressure to the sauce packet to allow the sauce to come out.         5   Spread the sauce on the crust with the top of the sauce packet. Run the sauce packet or your fingers over the pizza crust making sure the pizza sauce is evenly distributed.         6   Add the toppings. Locate the cheese and pepperoni in the lunchable and sprinkle some of the cheese over the pizza sauce then lay the pepperoni on top.         7   Cook the pizza. Place the pizza onto a microwave safe plate and pop it into the microwave for 15 seconds or until the cheese is melted.         8   Serve. Remove the pizza from the microwave and enjoy your childhood snack!

If you don't like certain ingredients in the lunchable such as the cheese or pepperoni then you don't have to use it in the pizza.  Use more ingredients to get the best pizza such as adding salt, pepper, garlic powder, \n",

Kids & Parenting  Teaching  Misc           Tired Mom Monday Dinner: Pizza Crescent Rolls    Sometimes when I have had a long day or just don’t have the energy to follow a recipe let alone try a new recipe, I have several meals and snacks as back up that are so easy to memorize and don’t require many ingredients! Granted, they might not all be super healthy, but some days, having anything prepared for my family beats eating out!

Privacy & Disclosure  Mini Biscuit Pizzas  April 4, 2012 By Alli  3 Comments  Pin 23K Yum 1K Share 177 +1 25 Tweet 24K Shares   Last night’s dinner was inspired by my husband. He suggested something he and his siblings ate all of the time when they were kids. His mom made them little pizzas on biscuits and they just loved them. I thought this was such a cute and clever idea! Especially for kids. We got everything going and put in the oven. Then Tyson turned on the TV and we saw a Pillsbury commercial with a “dinner idea” using the big biscuits to make pizzas. So much for our super creative idea! And I’m sure a lot of you have actually done this before. But I sure thought we were doing something pretty neat here! Oh well. They were delicious, fun to make, and even more fun to eat!     And this is all you need to make them. What a nice change of pace! Only four ingredients.             Begin by placing each unbaked biscuit onto a cookie sheet and flattening them out. You can make them as thin or as thick as you want, but they’re going to rise a little bit so you can make them pretty thin.   Then spread some pizza sauce over each flattened biscuit.   Next, sprinkle some mozzarella cheese over the top of the pizza sauce.   Add pepperoni slices or other desired toppings right over the cheese.   And that’s it! Just pop them in the oven and bake from here. Super easy dinner that everyone will love!      Print Mini Biscuit Pizzas    Yield: 8 servings Serving Size: 2 pizzas      Ingredients 2 packages canned jumbo biscuits 1 pkg pepperoni slices (or other desired pizza toppings) 2 c. mozzarella cheese, shredded 1 small jar pizza sauce Instructions Place biscuits on two ungreased cookie sheets.

Eating together is a chance to learn more about the people you hang out with by seeing what they like to eat. Here, four budding young home cooks in Calgary share their thoughts and recipes for a good lunch to go.  Genevieve Osberg     Open this photo in gallery       Genevieve Osberg loves making buddha bowls for lunch, whether at home or at school.  Todd Korol/The Globe and Mail     Genevieve, 15, isn’t strictly vegetarian, but she rarely eats meat, preferring the way vegetables, grains and legumes make her feel. “Eating well is part of the overall healthy lifestyle I’m trying to live,” she says. “I’m not against meat, or greasy foods like pizza. I just feel better and more energetic when I eat fresh and natural foods.”  Even beyond her like-minded circle of friends, Genevieve says more kids her age are making nutritionally and environmentally conscious food choices. “Consideration for the environment definitely plays a role in the foods I choose to eat,” she said. “I always go for organic when possible, and free-range for poultry.”       Story continues below advertisement         At home or for school, Genevieve loves building what’s commonly known as a buddha bowl – a portable vessel she can load with layers of grains like brown rice or quinoa, raw or roasted beets, carrots, fresh spinach, avocado and toasted nuts, and drizzle over a dressing of garlicky tahini, herby yogurt or tangy vinaigrette.  Each individual component keeps well in the fridge, and can be ready to assemble before or even after school, when her mom, dad and sister are eating at different times.    Buddha Bowl     Open this photo in gallery       Genevieve Osbergand's buddha bowl doesn't necessarily have to follow a specific recipe.  Todd Korol/The Globe and Mail     This dish doesn’t require a recipe per se, but a collection of ingredients with contrasting colours, textures and flavours that work well when you get them all together. What you use (and how much) can be dictated by your taste – or what happens to be in the fridge. Genevieve sometimes builds hers in a glass jar, keeping the dressing separate, to take to school.   Cooked brown rice, quinoa, faro or other grains  Fresh baby spinach, kale or chard, torn  Grated carrots  Cooked beets, chopped  Avocado, sliced or chopped  Chopped toasted or raw almonds or other nuts or seeds  Garlicky tahini dressing  3-4 tablespoons tahini  1 lemon, juiced (about 3 tablespoons)  2 tablespoons olive oil  2 tablespoons plain yogurt or water  1-2 garlic cloves, crushed  Salt and pepper   Layer the ingredients in a wide bowl.  Stir the dressing ingredients together in a small bowl or measuring cup, shake them in a jar or blend in a small food processor or blender.  Combine and enjoy.  Kai J. Moorthy     Open this photo in gallery       With help from his mom, Kai Moorthy taught himself to make omelettes with a big handful of chopped cilantro, chopped green onions and a pinch of chilis.  Todd Korol/The Globe and Mail     Kai inherited a love of cilantro from his grandmother, who makes a dense green fresh coriander (also known as cilantro) chutney that his family spreads on buttered bread to make sandwiches. With help from his mom, 10-year-old Kai taught himself to make omelettes with a big handful of chopped cilantro, chopped green onions and a pinch of chilis. It’s all stirred together with the eggs, then poured into a hot pan; the omelette cooks quickly while he toasts his bread, then folds the egg up as it cooks, sliding it out of the pan onto his toast to make a sandwich.       Story continues below advertisement           Story continues below advertisement     “It’s really easy to make,” says Kai, who often gets up extra early to make his own lunch before school, and is starting to help make dinner in the evenings. “The omelette is something special I came up with. It would be good with cheese inside, but I like it without.”  Cilantro omelette     Open this photo in gallery       A finished cilantro omelette.  Todd Korol/The Globe and Mail     It’s easy to double the ingredients and make a larger omelette to cut in half for two sandwiches. Kai likes to serve his with a few olives on the side.   2 eggs  1 handful fresh cilantro, chopped (mostly leaves)  1 green onion, chopped  Pinch of dried chili flakes or a chopped fresh chili (optional)  Salt  Vegetable oil, for cooking  Toast, if desired   In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, cilantro, green onions, chilis or chili flakes (if using them) and a pinch of salt with a fork.  Set a medium skillet over medium-high heat and add a drizzle of oil. When the pan is hot, pour the egg mixture into it and tilt the pan so that the uncooked egg runs underneath. As it sets, fold it in half or into a square and flip it to help it finish cooking. If you like, slide it out onto a piece of toast and eat open-faced, or top with another piece of toast to make a sandwich.  Chazz Choi     Open this photo in gallery       Chazz Choi plans to pack onigiri for lunch, two-bite rice balls (or in his case, round-tipped triangles) shaped by pressing sticky rice into plastic molds.  Todd Korol/The Globe and Mail     When Chazz’s large Chilean-Japanese-Korean family gets together, it always involves food. “We eat a whole variety of things, from homemade empanadas to Japanese curry,” says Chazz, who’s 12. His mom, grandma and great-grandma often cook together, and there are usually leftovers for lunch the next day. “I’m comfortable bringing anything I want to school, even Japanese curry,” he says. “It lets you get a taste of home. And when people tell me it looks weird, I’m like, ‘Yeah – and it tastes delicious.’ ”  This fall, Chazz, who starts Grade 7 this year – in Alberta, that means moving to a new junior high – plans to pack onigiri for lunch, two-bite rice balls (or in his case, round-tipped triangles) shaped by pressing sticky rice into plastic molds, then wrapping a strip of nori around the base, and rolling in or sprinkling with furikake, a Japanese seasoning made with dried fish, seaweed, sesame seeds, sugar, salt and often MSG. He likes packing them with teriyaki chicken or beef, or pressing a piece of meat into each onigiri as he shapes it. “They’re easy to eat,” he says, “especially when I’m hanging out with my friends. Lunch is the main time we get to talk, without anyone interrupting us.”       Story continues below advertisement         Onigiri     Open this photo in gallery       Chazz Choi's onigiri, left, with teriyaki chicken and carrots.  Todd Korol/The Globe and Mail     Cook as much sticky rice as you like on the stovetop or in your rice cooker, and once it’s cool enough to handle, roll it into balls or press it into rice molds.   Cooked sticky rice  Bits of cooked teriyaki chicken or beef (optional)  Nori (seaweed sheets)  Furikake   Press the sticky rice into small molds or roll them into balls, shaping the rice around a small piece of meat if you like. Cut small (about 1-inch long) strips of nori with scissors and wrap a piece around the base of each, where you might pick it up with your fingers. Sprinkle the tops with furikake, or spread some onto a small plate and roll the edge of the rice in it to coat.  Willem Van Rosendaal     Open this photo in gallery       Willem Van Rosendaal loves pizza, so stromboli make for a good portable alternative.  Todd Korol/The Globe and Mail     Willem, 13, is a self-described pizza fanatic, but finds it less than portable, so he’s been making (or helping to make) these pizza packages since kindergarten, stuffing them with ham, leftover sausage or salami, sometimes using pesto instead of tomato sauce or wrapping the dough around a piece of cheese and a pepperoni stick. Having grown up with a mother who’s a food writer (me), Willem is used to trying new things. And while he loves typical fast food like hot dogs and pizza, he also appreciates well-made versions of them with good ingredients and a less processed taste and texture. “It has to be decent, not too cheap,” he says. “The only problem is, if you bring something really good to school, everyone else will want to try it.”  Similar to calzone, these stromboli are compact packages that aren't too saucy and allow for all sorts of pizza-esque fillings. A batch lasts all week, individually wrapped and tucked into the freezer to grab and go. They’re just fine at room temperature, much like a cheese bun or pizza pretzel, but could also be warmed in the microwave.  Stromboli     Open this photo in gallery       Willem Van Rosendaal's homemade pizza pockets.  Todd Korol/The Globe and Mail     Feel free to swap thinly sliced pepperoni, veggies \n"

Stand mixer: In the bowl of a stand mixer with the whisk attachment, whisk the egg yolks, whole egg, garlic powder, Italian seasoning, butter, and buttermilk. Add 2 cups of the flour along with the yeast and salt. Whisk until moistened and combined. Remove the whisk attachment and replace with a dough hook. Add the remaining flour and knead on low speed for 5 minutes. Knead on low speed 5 minutes more or until the dough clears the sides of the bowl. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface; knead by hand about 30 seconds. Lightly oil a large bowl. Transfer the dough to the bowl, lightly oil the top of the dough, cover and let double in volume, 2 to 2½ hours. Once your dough is made, roll it out into a large rectangle – about the size of a half sheet baking pan. Combine a stick of softened butter with a tablespoon of garlic powder, and spread the mixture over top of the rolled out dough. Then, spread on your pizza sauce.

In order to make good pizza quickly, I've combined a couple of techniques and recipes. It takes a little longer than 30 minutes (about 2 hours) if you make your own dough.  If you don't want to make your own dough you can probably buy some at the local pizza place for a few dollars.  Or you can cut the rising time for the dough short and end up with a denser crust.  After you have the dough, it only takes about 30 minutes to lay out and bake the pizza. The first technique that I borrowed is to broil my pizza (from seriouseats.com ).  This cuts the baking time down to as little as 2 minutes by cooking it from both sides, and makes a great crispy crust with bubbling hot cheese. The recipe I used for the dough comes from \"Artisan Bread in Five Minutes a Day\" by Jeff Hertzberg and Zoe Francois.  The title is somewhat misleading, since 5 minutes is only the time it takes to mix together the ingredients.  It takes at least 2 hours if you follow their recipe.  Either way, the recipe is super easy to mix up and tastes great. Add Tip Ask Question Comment Download Step 1: Things You Will Need Hardware: ~An electric oven with a broiler element (gas works OK, but you won't get the same results) ~A cast iron skillet ~A pizza peel or wooden cutting board ~Rolling pin or other cylindrical object to roll out the dough ~Measuring cups ~A large sauce pan (about one half gallon or more) with a lid ~A spoon, a spatula, and some oven mitts. Pizza Dough (this will make about two large pizzas): ~2 3/4 cups lukewarm water ~1 1/2 T. granulated yeast ~1 1/2 T. salt ~1 T. sugar ~1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil ~6 1/2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour ~A few pinches of corn meal or grits (this is to keep the dough from sticking to the peel) Don't worry about being too precise; this recipe is very forgiving, even if you get the amounts slightly wrong. Pizza ingredients: ~Pizza sauce (I used canned sauce, but you can make your own if you want) ~Shredded mozzarella cheese (again, you can make your own if you want) ~Pepperoni \n",

Make my Pizza Monkey Bread the day before, then wow your family, friends, and pizza-loving acquaintances with both the pizza taste and new experience. Hi Bold Bakers! I love pizza, no matter what shape or form it comes in. Because of that, I made it my mission to come up with as many different ways to consume my favorite treat as possible. Normally, Monkey Bread is sweet — but Bigger Bolder Baking does not do normal! We think outside the box here. That’s how in a moment of crazy baking I came up with this recipe for a Big & Bold Pizza Monkey Bread! Monkey Bread is also known as pull apart, or tear and share, bread. The reason being is that everyone can pull off chunks and help themselves. It is a great dish to make for parties or get togethers because it’s made to be shared easily. And what I like most is you can make it the day before and bake it off when you need it. How To Begin Making Pizza Monkey Bread My dough is a soft bread roll dough, similar to dinner rolls. It is a lovely, simple recipe that can be made on a machine or by hand. Now, I just want to warn you, I have seen people using store bought biscuits and pizza dough to make Monkey Bread. That’s ok, we will convert them later. All those options are equally delicious but I would be doing you and myself an injustice if I didn’t show you a homemade dough. Getting The Perfect Bake This bread is like an upside down bread, so when baking it you want to get a lovely, golden brown bread on top to ensure that the dough on the bottom of the tin is getting nicely baked as well. You often see a Monkey Bread with a lighter colored bottom which is totally normal, you just want to make sure it is fully baked all the way through. Leave it in for the full time and resist the urge open the oven while baking. Make sure to try out my favorite 5 Minute Pizza Sauce recipe. And looking for more Pizza Recipes?

Course:  Dinner  Cuisine:  American  Servings : 12   Calories : 174  kcal  Author : Gemma Stafford Ingredients  3 ¼  cups  (1lb1oz/461g) all-purpose flour  2 ¼  teaspoons  (6g/1/4 oz) active dried yeast  2  teaspoons  salt  1 ¼  cups  (10floz/280ml) milk  2  tablespoons  (1oz/28g) butter, cubed  2  cups  (16oz/450g) pizza sauce/tomato sauce    20  slices  pepperoni  , chopped  3  cloves  garlic  , crushed  2 ½  cups  (8oz/225g) mozzerella, grated  Bunch of fresh basil  , chopped Instructions To Make the Dough: Mix the flour, yeast, and salt together in a standing mixer fitted with a dough hook. In a measuring jug, heat the milk and butter until lukewarm and the butter is melted. Turn the machine on low and slowly add the milk mixture. Mix for 2 minutes to wake up the yeast. Increase the speed to medium and mix for roughly 6-8 minutes, or until the dough is shiny and smooth. When your dough is ready, take it off the machine and coat the dough and bowl with olive oil (or any flavorless oil). This will help it rise in the bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough rise at room temperature until doubled, 1 ½ -2 hours. To Make the Pizza filling: In a large bowl add the tomato sauce, pepperoni, garlic, cheese, and basil. Set aside in the fridge until you are ready for it. Once the dough has proofed, gently remove the dough from the bowl, knocking out the air. Using a bench scraper or knife, cut the dough into medium and small sized pieces. If you cut them too big the monkey bread can seem a bit doughy. Gently stir the cut dough into the pizza sauce, coating every piece of dough in tomato sauce. Grease a 10 inch Bundt pan or cake tin with butter. Fill the pan with the monkey bread dough and even out the dough with a spatula. Cover the Bundt pan tightly with plastic wrap and let the monkey bread rise for 45 minutes or until puffy and they have risen up to the top of the pan. (At this point you can cover it and pop it in the fridge overnight to be baked the off the next day fresh.) Bake at 350°F (180°C) for 35-40 minutes or until the top is beautifully brown. Cool the monkey bread in the pan for 5 minutes, then turn out on a platter or large plate and allow to cool slightly, about 10 minutes. Enjoy straight away!

Reply     Gemma Stafford  on October 21, 2016 at 2:13 am Hi there Zainab, Use cooked and spiced chicken, it will not be a good idea to use raw chicken in this type of recipe. It is worth a shot! Gemma 🙂 Reply     Sam  on October 19, 2016 at 4:06 pm Hi Gemma!! Can I use instant yeast or instant dry yeast for this one? Active dry yeast is hard ti find here. I hope you can reply huhu cause I’ll be doing this for my midterm exams in my baking subject huhh Reply     Gemma Stafford  on October 20, 2016 at 2:02 am Hi Sam, Yes, these will work for you. good job taking baking in your exams, this is a skill for life, I wish you well. do practice this ahead of the exams too, your family will love it, Gemma 🙂 Reply     Toni Owens  on September 28, 2016 at 11:59 pm Also was wondering, can this recipe be used for loaf bread or do you have another for that? Thanks again!! Reply     Gemma Stafford  on September 29, 2016 at 1:12 am Ha ha! this is great, now you are baking, and enjoying it! You can use the no knead pizza dough recipe as a bread dough, and also the Cinnamon Bread recipe here ( https://www.biggerbolderbaking.com/?s=Cinnamon+bread ) has a good basic dough to which the additions have been made. have fun, and experiment, sounds like you are enjoying this! 🙂 Reply     Toni Owens  on September 29, 2016 at 6:17 am Will definitely try these. Temperature is dropping here. Love baking when it’s cool. I tried uploading pictures but not sure they made it. I will try again. Reply     Gemma Stafford  on September 30, 2016 at 2:13 am Thank you Toni, i will check out the photos now. Nothing like a warm kitchen when it is cold outside! It is warming up here in California! 🙂 Reply     Toni Owens  on September 28, 2016 at 10:05 pm I couldn’t wait to make this. Used pepperoni, chopped pineapple and fresh chopped spinach. Was out of pizza sauce so I used spaghetti sauce. It was delicious. My friend took some to work for lunch the next day. Already thinking about shrimp and mushroom. So easy and delicious. Thank you. Reply     Fred Widerick  on September 23, 2016 at 4:00 pm Gemma; Would this recipe for the bread portion also work well as a conventional pizza dough? Reply     Gemma Stafford  on September 24, 2016 at 1:27 am Sure Fred, but there is a no knead pizza dough recipe here on the website! this is as good as it gets, Gemma 🙂 Reply     EvergreenSouls  on September 11, 2016 at 9:15 pm Oh my gosh, Miss Gemma! It was absolutely delicious! I was a teensy bit skeptical on baking it a second time because the first time I made it it didn’t turn out great –  I had over proofed it. But when I made it on Saturday, it turned out good! I accidentally scorched the top a little & the bottom of the bread got stuck even though I greased it, so I had to dig it out, but my parents loved it. Thanks for the recipe! Reply     Gemma Stafford  on September 12, 2016 at 1:14 am That is great, well done you! Baking is a learning curve too, you learn a lot by trying again and again. it is how you perfect a recipe, so it is great that you did not give up on this. Next time try greasing the pan, then scatter a little flour around on the butter, shake the pant to distribute it, and throw out the excess. This will give you a well prepared pan for all of your baking, Gemma 🙂 Reply     EvergreenSouls  on September 15, 2016 at 4:20 am Will do, Miss Gemma! Thank you for the tip! Reply     MeridieLegna  on August 19, 2016 at 6:02 am Hi Gemma! My boyfriend always asks me when I bake sweets “is there meat in it?” So I was really glad that you shared this recipe with us! His birthday is coming and I thought this will be the perfect birthday cake for him. 😉 I tried your other monkey bread, and was thinking, can I put some extra cheese and ham into the nuggets? So, I will try it out tomorrow! 😀 wish me luck! Love MeridieLegna Reply     Gemma Stafford  on August 19, 2016 at 12:51 pm Ha ha! your boyfriend sounds like a real man! you can add other ingredients to this, do not add uncooked meats though! if he likes pepperoni this would be good, Gemma 🙂 Reply     LarsAngstmann  on August 19, 2016 at 2:11 am And I almost forgot: The Pizza Monkey Bread tastes heavenly. 😉 Reply     LarsAngstmann  on August 14, 2016 at 9:03 am Hi Gemma, Thank you fort this recipe. My monkey Bread is freshly out of the oven and still too hot to eat, but it smells insane. But while baking it, you netter be patient. During the process of proofing I thought that would be the hardest part: waiting two hours fort tue dough to riss. But fort people linke me who arge not patient at all, tue Banking ans cooling is definitely the hardest part. I’ve gone nuts Düring Banking: tue delicious smell and the Look of it, heavenly. This surely is ohne of tue best ways Pizza can come in. Greetings form Germany, Lars Reply     Gemma Stafford  on August 15, 2016 at 2:22 am Hi Lars, I am happy that you are in the kitchen, learning to bake with yeast, and learning to be patient. Cooking does require some patience, but it is a great hobby, and you get to have lovely things to eat, win win I say! Happy baking to you in Germany, Gemma 🙂 Reply     LarsAngstmann  on August 18, 2016 at 12:37 am Thank you fort your kindness and your answers. Baking with yeast is no problem, I’m used to it. But waiting is always the hardest part, especially with that delicious things. I’ve been baking my entire lief, 16 years, and sometimes I am patient (if I want to ;)). But this monkey bread was something totally new for me, I love pizza and I wanted to know how it will turn out. For me, new recipes and patience are not a good match. I am always curious to see the result of the new recipe. But I’m always pulling myself together and wait for the time given in the Recife to ensure a good result. Love your Banking, Lars Reply     Gemma Stafford  on August 18, 2016 at 1:09 am I see! I am dealing with an expert! I too am impatient when trying a new recipe, but it sounds like you have the instinct to make any recipe work. Its is amazing how you learn to read a recipe and know that it is right, that is just what you are talking about, experience 🙂 Can’t trump that! Gemma Reply     LarsAngstmann  on August 19, 2016 at 2:08 am Oh thank you for your kind words. But ‘expert’, I don’t think so. I believe that a good recipe and love are the most important steps in baking and that they are the steps ensuring success in baking.  Thanks to your recipes and your love in them, as well as my love in baking, I end up with a good result. Thank you for sharing your love and passion with us through your recipes and thereby giving us the opportunity to make baking for us successful and unique. Lars Reply     Gemma Stafford  on August 19, 2016 at 1:03 pm Hi Lars, I am happy that these recipes are working for you, thank yuo for yuor kind comments, Gemma 🙂     Angelica  on August 6, 2016 at 4:15 pm I’m in the middle of making this and realized that flour measurement in grams is wrong. It’s supposed to be 390 not 490. My kids are waiting for this and driving me crazy because it looks delicious. Let’s hope for the best. Reply     Gemma Stafford  on August 8, 2016 at 2:42 pm Hi Angelica, Follow the recipe, cup measurements change according to the ingredients, cornstarch will weigh lighter than flour for instance, Gemma 🙂 Reply     Runim munir hafiez  on August 4, 2016 at 2:42 am Wow, Gemma! This bread looks so good! But I had a question: Is this bread supposed be eaten at dinner or is it supposed to be eaten Teatime? Please do let me know. Love, Runim Reply     Gemma Stafford  on August 4, 2016 at 1:56 pm tea time mostly. It’s very filling 🙂 Reply     Runimo Munir hafiez  on August 5, 2016 at 2:43 am Thanks! Reply     Pratyusha Cherukumilli  on July 17, 2016 at 11:17 pm Hello Gemma, Tried Pull apart bread pizza today and it came out pretty well. My only let down was that the pizza was quite dough-y so me and my hubby could taste a lot of dough at places. I’ll learn measuring the ingredients better next time. Nevertheless, it looked yummy ! Love Pratyusha Reply     Gemma Stafford  on July 18, 2016 at 12:48 am Hi Pratyusha, it sounds like you did not bake it for long enough, or at a high enough temperature! Baking is a science, you do need to pay close attention to all of the steps. Do try it again, it is good! Thank you for being in touch, Gemma 🙂 Reply     Julie  on July 14, 2016 at 1:18 pm Would I be able to use you no knead pizza dough for this recipie? Reply     Gemma Stafford  on July 15, 2016 at 8:51 am Hi Julie, Yes you can! you can use this for lots of recipes, it is only limited by your imagination, so experiment wit it, Gemma 🙂 Reply     aarnwine4788  on July 14, 2016 at 10:00 am I will be making this very soon, looks super yummy. Can’t wait to see even more recipes like this! Reply     Gemma Stafford  on July 15, 2016 at 1:12 pm Hi there, That is great, it is a lovely place to start, Gemma 🙂 Reply     Robin  on July 8, 2016 at 12:38 pm after going over the comment, saw pizza dough can be used. thx Reply     Robin  on July 8, 2016 at 12:36 pm can this be made with regular pizza dough? Reply     Gemma Stafford  on July 9, 2016 at 12:43 pm Hi Robin, this is indeed a really versatile dough. Get it right and you will be able to adapt it to all sorts of recipes, sweet and savory. Change the liquids to milk/butter etc and you will change the texture. it is really worth experimenting with this basic dough, Gemma 🙂 Reply     Hina  on July 7, 2016 at 9:33 pm Hi there! I don’t eat pork products, so could you recommend pizza ingredients without the pepperoni? Thanks! It looks so delicious! Reply     Gemma Stafford  on July 7, 2016 at 10:58 pm you can leave it out no problem. If you want you can add in olives \n"
